                  A finite element formulation is proposed to implement the Discontinuous Galerkin method in commercial FE code (here, Abaqus). Such an implementation leads to the definition of perfect interfaces, and then, allows the definition of extrinsic cohesive zone. The proposed element is tested in a simple mechanical configuration, and the influence of several parameters is focused on. Formulation limitations are last explained.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A commonly used method to allow cracks to appear and to propagate in finite element models is based on the cohesive zone approach. Since their first development by Dugdale [1] and Barrenblat [2], various formulations have been proposed, based on inverse identification (depending on the studied problem) or thanks to atomic theoretical considerations.

Cohesive finite elements are interfacial ones, which are inserted between two classical FE; their mechanical behavior (Traction-Separation Law, or TSL) models the progressive damage of the interface, from undamaged state up to total failure.

Cohesive zone elements might be implemented in various commercial Finite Element (FE) codes thanks to user subroutines, or are even included as standard procedures. Accounting for potential convergence problems [3], the failure of numerical structures is then possible.

The use of these elements, however, induces several artifacts, directly linked to the pre-debonding part of the TSL, which corresponds to a – very tough – spring-like interfacial element: while inserted in a mesh, cohesive elements lead to a global deterioration of the Finite Element structure mechanical properties [4,5]. For certain configurations, where a crack path is not a priori supposed, numerical failure might also exhibit a mesh-dependency [6].

To avoid such problems, several strategies might be used. One of them is based on the use of extrinsic cohesive elements, for which the undamaged interface cannot open, whatever the interfacial stress [7,8]. The extrinsic TSL, however, is not an application, and the implementation of such an element in Finite Element programs is highly problematic, being dependent on the way the mechanical solution is computed by the FE program [9]. Extrinsic behavior can nevertheless be defined thanks to an implicit pre-debonding TSL definition, based on the use of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.

The discontinuous Galerkin Method has been introduced by Reed [10] in 1973 to solve transport problems, and to get solutions in which potential discontinuities do not create artificial oscillations. The DG method has then been extensively used for a large game of problems (see [11] for a review). Because the DG method deals with unknown fields discontinuities, it is well adapted to crack initiation problems, in which a crack path is defined in a solid which remains undamaged up to a critical stress value. Across this potential discontinuity surface, the unknown displacement field has to remain continuous until the onset of failure. This method has then been developed for crack initiation and propagation problems [12] and applied to various configurations [13–19].

Because of its formulation and its implicit properties, the integration of such a method in commercial programs is not easy due to the available data which are transferred to user subroutines, and its implementation is mainly performed in home-made FE codes or open sources ones (e.g., [20]). We aim in the present paper at proposing a finite element formulation which allows the DG method implementation in FE commercial programs, avoiding the problem due to the implicit pre-debonding TSL formulation. Such an element consequently allows the definition of perfect interfaces. This element was implemented in Abaqus, using a User ELement subroutine (UEL).

The DG method is first presented, and, based on a simple 1D analytical problem, the finite element configuration is derived. The interfacial pre-debonding TSL is then focused, and especially, the influence of mechanical parameters. Last, formulation limitations are pointed out.

The Finite Element formulation (DG-element) presented here is based on an analytical resolution of the Discontinuous Galerkin method applied on a simple 1D problem. This resolution is first presented, and the main DG-element characteristics derived; the element formulation is last generalized for any 2D-problems.

Let us consider a bar with a length

                           L

                        + and Ω
                        −, by an interface S
                        
                           cz
                        , and submitted to an imposed displacement

Each bar subpart is meshed with one linear finite element, separated by an interface on which no boundary conditions are prescribed. On each node, only one degree of freedom (dof) q
                        
                           i
                         is considered, representing the nodal displacement in the bar direction. Node no. 2 corresponds to

                        ; on these two nodes, displacements are unknown, but are computed thanks to the DG method.

Displacements are imposed on nodes 1 and 4, respectively equal to 0 and

On each half bar, deformation and stress are constant and equal to

                         formulation one can find in the literature [12]:

                           L
                        , γ being a constant and L the surrounding mesh size.

From this simple analysis, it can be seen that, to get a perfect interface definition in Finite Element analysis, it is necessary to modify the stiffness matrix of the neighboring elements.

Using classical cohesive element definition for interfacial modeling, i.e., for the considered problem, a 2-node interfacial element, the problem stiffness matrix (Eq. (14)) must be rewritten as

Using classical cohesive element to implement the DG method leads consequently to a natural opening of the interface, and then, an impossibility to model extrinsic behavior.

The solution consists in developing an element whose nodes recover the neighboring elements ones: its stiffness matrix will then affect the one of the latter elements, theoretically allowing the implementation of the DG method, and the definition of perfect interfaces.

A 2D Finite Element formulation based on the DG method (thereafter called DG-element) is proposed in the next section, based on the previous analysis, to model perfect interfaces, leading to extrinsic cohesive elements definition.

The DG-element has then been defined as a 8-node element, composed of two bilinear standard 4-node elements and an interfacial one.

Mechanical properties and interpolation functions of the upper and lower 4-nodes elements must be the same than the one used in the surrounding elements (e.g., CPE4 in Abaqus for a plane strain problem). The DG-element is supposed to be superposed to the interface surrounding mesh, allowing the modification of the whole neighboring element stiffness matrix (Fig. 3
                        ), and thus, the implementation of the DG method.

For the upper and lower 4-node element, it is possible to get the stress

                         at each point, based on both the elasticity tensor

It is worth noting that before solving the DG problem, all of the internal variables must be computed for the upper and lower part of the DG-element, as well as the tangent modulus (using, e.g., a Newton–Raphson resolution scheme).

The 8-node finite element has been defined in Abaqus thanks to a User Element subroutine definition [25]. This element and its implementation have been tested on a simple configuration. In the following, only the cohesive stage is focused on.

The UEL subroutine has been compiled using a “-r8” flag, and real⁎8 variables have been used; such a configuration leads to a precision in computed variables equal to [26]

The DG-element behavior has been tested on a simple mechanical configuration to get its ability to model a perfect interface, and the influence of several parameters on its TSL before debonding has been focused on. Results of these computations are summarized thereafter.

A 2D-rectangular sample has been considered, whose height and width were respectively 20 and 2mm. This sample was submitted on the one hand to an imposed displacement, and on the other hand to a symmetric boundary condition (Fig. 4
                        ). The material was assumed to be an elastic one, the Young modulus and the Poisson ratio being respectively E and ν.

The sample was regularly meshed using four-nodes bilinear elements, with full integration, and plane stress assumptions (CPS4 in Abaqus). It was regularly meshed, with n
                        
                           e
                         elements along the interface. The mesh size was characterized by n
                        
                           e
                        , the number of element along S
                        
                           cz
                        .

A default configuration has been set, the parameters values of which being E=1MPa, ν=0 and n
                        
                           e
                        =1. The corresponding reference stabilization parameter is thus

                        MPa/mm.

All computations presented thereafter were performed with 100 iterations, whatever the applied load and/or configuration, for the sake of comparison.

Unless specified, default configuration parameters were used.

First computations sets were performed considering a tensile loading (with a 10mm imposed displacement along the y direction, see Fig. 4) and a shear one (with a 2mm imposed displacement along the x direction). For this latter, periodic boundary conditions were added along the two sample side parallel to the y direction. Last,

                         was used.

Computed DG-element TSLs are plotted in Fig. 5
                        .

For these two loading cases, it can be observed that opening values were strictly proportional to ϵrr, and being alternatively positive and negative.

Both Δ
                        
                           n
                         and Δ
                        
                           t
                        , furthermore, appear to behave as random-like variables, with no apparent relationship between their value and the corresponding interfacial stress; only their extremums seem to be affected by the interfacial stress.

The DG-element cohesive stage behavior was consequently evaluated thanks to the probabilistic characteristic of the 100 computed opening values, i.e., with

For the two loading considered here, probabilistic characteristics are reported in Table 1
                        . It can be observed that, for shear applied loading,

                                 Δ
                              
                           
                         is equal to 0, denoting a symmetric distribution of computed tangent opening.

To get a panorama of the DG-element domain of validity, several parameters influences on its pre-debonding TSL have been focused on, and, especially, the FE characteristics (finite element size L and interfacial discretization n
                        
                           e
                        ), and the mechanical parameters (E, ν, k
                        
                           n
                        ).

Because no slight differences appeared while comparing tensile and shear loadings, only tensile loading was considered, and consequently, only Δ
                        
                           n
                         probabilistic characteristics are shown below.

Several computations were performed considering k
                        
                           n
                         values varying from 10−9 up to 106
                        MPa/mm. Results are plotted in Fig. 6
                        .

For k
                        
                           n
                         values higher than 
                           2
                           
                              
                                 k

                                 ref
                              
                           
                        , Δ
                        
                           n
                         values remain close to the ϵrr one, and appeared to be k
                        
                           n
                        -independent (Fig. 6a). For such k
                        
                           n
                         values, the DG-element tends to model a perfect interface.

When the stabilization parameter decreases, however, Δ
                        
                           n
                         values notably increase, characterizing the progressive loss of the DG-element extrinsic behavior (and the nonexistence of a solution while k
                        
                           n
                         tends to be close to 0).

                         is thereafter considered to be part of the default configuration: for such a stabilization parameter value, the DG-element TSL is expected to be extrinsic.

The influence of mechanical parameters on the DG-element TSL is summarized in Fig. 7
                        .

From Fig. 7b, it can be seen that Δ
                        
                           n
                         statistical properties tend to increase with E, remaining very close to ϵrr for a large Young׳s modulus range. Nor ν neither E affect the interfacial TSL behavior (Fig. 7a), which remained extrinsic.

                         statistical characteristics was focused on. Two computations were performed, based on the default configuration, but considering on the one hand a smaller sample (n

                        ), and on the other hand a higher interfacial discretization (

In Fig. 8a, it can be seen that the interfacial response of the DG-element is k

For non-linear mechanical behavior, it has been seen that the reference stabilization parameter is no longer constant along the problem resolution, but depends on each iterations. To remain consistent with the previous parametric study, the stabilization parameter has to be chosen so that

                         represent the maximum of the tangent modulus for the considered mechanical behavior. For elastoplastic material, 
                           
                              
                                 E

                           E
                        , and then the reference stabilization parameter for the whole computations is the same than the one defined for elastic materials.

Considering uniform stress distribution along the interface, the DG-element is then able to define a perfect interface, being both material and FE discretization independent. The only critical parameter is to be the stabilization one, and its minimal value for the DG-element to had an extrinsic behavior was exhibited to be proportional to k
                        n
                     
                     
                        ref
                     .

The DG-element TSL, however, is highly dependent on the average stress 
                        〈
                        T
                        〉
                      computation, which depends on several parameters, such as the 4-nodes FE formulation ability to give an accurate stress field, or the structure discretization (i.e., the error in global stress field computation).

To exhibit the limitation of the proposed element formulation, two examples were chosen, in which 
                        〈
                        T
                        〉
                      computation was inaccurate, and consequently, the DG-element unable to model an extrinsic interfacial element. It is worth noting that such limitations and errors are not related to the DG-element definition as a 8-node finite element, but rather to the surrounding mesh own limitations.

The sample was submitted to a non-uniform but symmetric loading, leading to a bending stress state (Fig. 9
                        ). For this computations, it was used n

                        . Sample dimensions were still 20mm high and 2mm wide.

In each DG-element, the stress field is no longer constant, but the 4-node bilinear elements are able to compute an accurate stress field in the whole sample. The computation of the DG-element stiffness matrix, however, became integration-scheme dependent (Eq. (24)). Several integration schemes were thus considered to illustrate this dependency, using 1, 2 and 3 Gauss Point, and 1 and 2 Newton–Cotes points. At the end of the bending computation, normal openings were extracted at every interfacial integration points, the results being plotted in Fig. 10
                        a.

For such an heterogeneous loading, it appears that the maximum normal opening value at the end of the computations was consistent with the traction results (see Fig. 8b), i.e., few ϵrr, with no slight difference between integration scheme, but for 1 Gauss Point and 2 Newton–Cotes integration scheme. For these two laters, the DG-element did not allow to get a perfect interface: due to integration errors, the computed average interfacial stress did not fit to the one that should have been computed in sample without DG-element. As a consequence, side effects appeared, and the DG-element tends to degenerate towards a spring interfacial element, the stiffness of which is proportional to k
                        
                           n
                        .

A 0.6mm crack was introduced along the interface, considering a 3 Gauss Point integration scheme for which integrations errors were minimum; the other parameters remained unchanged. Computation result can be seen in Fig. 11
                        .

As in the previous example, it can be seen in Fig. 12
                        a and b that the DG-element is unable to lead to an extrinsic interfacial behavior: near the crack tip, normal opening increases and tend to diverge. None of the interfacial DG-element exhibit a satisfactory response.

As previously, the computed average interfacial stress 
                           〈
                           T
                           〉
                         was far from being the theoretical one, due to the finite element discretization and the unability of 4-nodes finite elements to gave accurate stress fields in the whole sample, especially near the crack tip: this non-reliability of the used FE to model the problem induced the inefficiency of the DG-element to give a perfect interfacial behavior, even if the computed stress fields and interfacial opening were better than the one computed using an intrinsic cohesive element (Fig. 12b).

The DG-element׳s degenerate behavior, due to errors in the computed mechanical fields in the interface neighborhood, led to severe limitation for such an element use in structural computation, for no perfect mechanical fields can be derived from a general finite element computation. It is then needed to improve the proposed element, to increase its application range in term of mechanical problems.

We propose to define an internal variable 
                           
                              
                                 Δ
                              
                              
                                 o
                              
                           
                        , following [27], which act in the DG-element as a virtual opening. The aim of such a variable is to decrease the computed interfacial opening

                         in case of DG-element׳s degenerate behavior: Eq. (4) is rewritten so that

The stress field in the cracked sample (Fig. 11) has been re-estimated using the DG-element correction; results are shown in Fig. 13
                        .

It can be seen that using an internal variable does not allow to fully recover a perfect interfacial behavior; computed openings, however, have been highly lowered, at least far from the singularity. In Fig. 13b is shown a comparison of the numerical stress field around the crack tip, considering or not the use of

                        : even if limited, the decrease of the DG-element opening near the crack tip leads to a consequent increase of the stress field, from 2400MPa to 3000MPa.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

As it has been shown in the previous sections, DG-elements lead to the creation of a perfect interface as soon as the surrounding mesh allows the computation of an accurate stress field, which is never the case but in few simple configurations. Adding an internal variable in the DG-element formulation highly limits this degenerescence, even if the interface remains far from being perfect.

The use of other finite element than bilinear 4-node ones as upper and lower DG-element parts (e.g., quadratic square, linear or quadratic triangular elements) could consequently contribute to an increase of the accuracy of the neighboring computed mechanical fields, and then to a decrease of the related interfacial opening. The only restriction on the DG-element definition is the needed coincidence between the upper and lower DG-elements and the ones on which they are superposed.

It might be underlined, based on the previous remarks, that DG-elements can be also defined in 3D finite element meshes, the limitations for the definition of a perfect interface being the same than for the 2D configuration.

A double Cleavage Drilled Compression (DCDC) specimen has been considered, for the crack propagation in such a test is a progressive one [29]. The sample was 25mm long and 7.5mm wide; a 1mm radius hole has been defined in the sample center. The considered material is an elastic one, with 
                        ν
                        =
                        0
                      and E=10,000MPa.

An imposed displacement has been applied on the DCDC sample, and symmetry conditions have been assumed. A crack path is defined along the sample symmetry line (see Fig. 14
                        a).

The bar is meshed using 4 nodes bilinear elements, with plane stress assumptions, with full integration, while modified DG-cohesive elements (DGCZ – see Eq. (37) –, the DG part of which being modified according to Section 5.3) have been introduced along the crack path. The element size along the latter is 0.05mm (i.e., with 5000 finite elements on the crack path).

The DGCZ parameters have been set to

@&#RESULTS@&#

In Fig. 15
                         are drawn the crack initiation and propagation along the pre-defined crack path. Debonding occurs for an applied displacement equal to −0.003mm (i.e., an applied deformation of 0.12%).

In Fig. 16
                         is plotted the computed interfacial TSL for a given modified-DGCZ element, superposed with a bilinear one, the initial stiffness of which being

                                 k
                              
                              
                                 n
                              
                              
                                 ref
                              
                           
                        .

It can be seen that using modified-DGCZ elements allows to get very low interfacial openings, even if the interface is not a perfect one. Interfacial opening differences between the modified DGCZ and a classical bilinear cohesive zone tend to decrease when the interfacial stress increases, but seems to tend towards 104 at the onset of debonding.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

An original finite element formulation has been proposed to allow the modeling of perfect interface behavior in finite element computations. The element weak formulation was based on the Discontinuous Galerkin method and the element shape on a theoretical analysis made on a 1D problem. The influence of mechanical and finite element parameters on its interfacial pre-debonding TSL was focused on, and it was proved to be able to exhibit extrinsic TSL as soon as the stabilization parameter value was set greater to few k
                        n
                     
                     
                        ref
                     . With such a value, interfacial opening, both normal and tangential, exhibited a random-like behavior with values, proportional to the natural computation error ϵrr, and was unaffected by the variation of both mechanical and finite element configurations.

The DG-element formulation, however, has got limitations. The estimation of the average interfacial stress 
                        〈
                        T
                        〉
                     , especially, is a critical issue: as soon as 
                        〈
                        T
                        〉
                      is misestimated, the DG-element TSL loses its extrinsic characteristics, interfacial opening its random-like properties and its relationship to ϵrr. These limitations might be due to surrounding FE own limitations (e.g., a mechanical problem with a singularity) or to the integration process while computing the DG-element stiffness matrix. This is especially a problem while dealing with material behavior with internal variables, which are to be determined in the DG-element formulation.

For such configurations, the DG-element behaves like an interfacial spring element, with a stiffness, however, greater than k
                     
                        n
                     .

Based on such an element formulation, the development of extrinsic cohesive zone is thus possible in commercial FE codes, as soon as the computed surrounding element stress field is accurate enough.
