                  The one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation with a time-periodic inflow boundary condition is investigated within the context of a newly developed optimal spatiotemporal reduced order modeling (OPSTROM) framework. Flow simulations are carried out with a conventional finite-difference scheme, and are expedited by coarsening the computational grid in space and time. The OPSTROM framework is used to maintain reliable predictions for the flow by constructing interactive subgrid-scale models to account for the effects due to unresolved spatial and temporal scales. Model construction is data-driven, and is based upon principles of mean-square error minimization, conditional expectations and stochastic estimation. The results indicate a need to model both subgrid spatial and temporal scales in order to improve the accuracy of under-resolved simulations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems, the range of scales to be represented in a simulation is determined by the space–time computational grid and the accuracy of the discretization scheme. Often the analyst aims to predict only large-scale quantities of interest [1,2]. For many systems, however, it may be necessary to resolve small-scale quantities below the threshold of interest due to significant coupling between multiscale spatiotemporal structures [3]. Hence, with a standard discretization scheme, a highly refined computational grid may be required to obtain reliable predictions. A so-called fully resolved simulation (FRS) renders the most accurate solution with respect to the scales considered relevant.

The computational expense required to conduct a FRS can be prohibitive. For instance, when a large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) are used in a simulation, the required memory can exceed available resources and the simulation time can become excessive. These challenges can, in principle, be overcome by developing a reduced order model (ROM) in space and/or time [4]. The primary objective of a ROM is to predict macroscale behavior as accurately as possible with a reduced computational burden. From a mathematical perspective, a ROM often involves the expansion of a problem field into a set of known basis vectors whose unknown coefficients are found using either a Ritz or weighted residual method. Normal mode analysis (NMA) for solid mechanics is perhaps the most well-known example in which the basis vectors are functions of space. The harmonic balance (HB) approach [5,6] is a classic example of constructing a ROM with basis vectors that are functions of time. Many of the ROMs fundamental to the fields of aerodynamics and aeroelasticity are based upon Volterra series [7] and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) [8]. The common theme with all ROMs is that they provide affordable simulations by resolving fewer scales than a FRS. As such, we suggest that any simulation method should be considered as a ROM if it fails to provide the resolution of a FRS. This includes discretization schemes based upon finite-difference (FD), finite-element (FE), finite-volume (FV), and spectral methods.

The origin of errors intrinsic to any ROM can be traced back to the unresolved (subgrid-scale) dynamics and their interactions with the resolved dynamics. Macroscale quantities in a nonlinear system are coupled with the microscale quantities [1]. Without proper knowledge about the subgrid-scale dynamics and their interactions with the resolved dynamics, the discretized governing equations cannot be solved accurately [2]. This sort of issue is known throughout the physics literature as the closure problem. In a standard ROM, closure is implicitly neglected as the subgrid-scale dynamics, and their statistical moments are effectively set to zero. For many applications, neglecting closure can lead to intolerable discretization errors.

In the fluids community, a simulation that completely resolves all relevant spatial and temporal scales in a turbulent flow governed by the Navier–Stokes equations is said to be a direct numerical simulation (DNS) [9]. Conceptually equivalent to a FRS, the expense required for a DNS is often prohibitive. As an alternative, the numerical method known as large-eddy simulation (LES) [10,11] is formulated to resolve only the large-scale motions in a turbulent flow, whereas the Kolmogorov microscales [12], which are most expensive to resolve, are modeled in some form. With the LES approach, subgrid-scale models are designed to provide closure by accounting for the effects due to unresolved spatial scales. Out of all the subgrid-scale models developed for LES, the ones proposed by Smagorinsky [13,14] are perhaps the most widely known. A wealth of information on various other types of subgrid-scale models can be found throughout the fluids literature [15–17].

In a special variant of LES known as optimal LES (OLES) [18–22], model construction is data-driven and based upon the optimal prediction formalism [23–29] such that the mean-square error is minimized between the subgrid-scale models and the quantities for which they are designed to replace. The OLES approach can be used to expedite numerical simulations for turbulent flows (by coarsening the computational grid in the spatial domain) while maintaining reliable predictions for the quantities of interest (by preserving the underlying spatial statistical structure). Previous OLES models have been appraised for their ability to account for the effects due to subgrid-scale convection and diffusion terms, which arise due to the use of coarse spatial grids [18–22]. It should be emphasized, however, that in OLES and all other known LES models to date, only the effects due to subgrid spatial scales are addressed. Valid or not, all time scales are assumed to be fully resolved. As such, OLES models are able to improve the accuracy of predictions for multi-point in space, but only single-point in time statistics of turbulent flows. This limitation may perhaps be the reason why some state of the art LES models are unable to accurately predict the evolution of certain flow structures [34,35]. Nevertheless, the basic principles behind OLES can be applied to any nonlinear dynamical system in addition to turbulent flows. As such, we consider OLES to be a specialized form of optimal spatial reduced order modeling (OPSROM).

Beyond OLES and OPSROM, the authors have suggested in previous works [36–39] that a significant amount of computational savings can be achieved by coarsening the temporal grid while maintaining reliable predictions for the quantities of interest (by preserving the underlying temporal statistical structure). To this end, we recently proposed the optimal temporal reduced order modeling (OPTROM) framework [36,37]. Unlike OLES and OPSROM, the OPTROM approach is formulated to account for the effects of unresolved time scales. As a proof of concept, under-resolved time-marching and time-spectral simulations were carried out for the canonical Duffing [36] and van der Pol [37] oscillators. When subgrid-scale models were included in the simulations, errors were typically reduced by one to two orders of magnitude for a given resolution. Since the Duffing and van der Pol oscillators contain no spatial dependence, there was no need to address subgrid spatial scales.

The newly developed optimal spatiotemporal reduced order modeling (OPSTROM) framework [38,39] is formulated to enable fast and reliable analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems by accounting for the combined effects due to unresolved spatial scales (as in OLES or OPSROM) and unresolved temporal scales (as in OPTROM). Several key features distinguish the OPSTROM framework from other multiscale models [1–3]:

                           Effects due to unresolved spatial and temporal scales are accounted for.

Subgrid-scale dynamics are derived using filters tailored to the ROM.

Subgrid-scale models are designed to interact with the resolved scales.

Model construction is data-driven, and is based upon principles of mean-square error minimization, conditional expectations and stochastic estimation.

By construction, the subgrid-scale models are consistent with the underlying spatiotemporal statistical structure of the nonlinear dynamical system.

The primary objective of this paper is to investigate application of the OPSTROM framework for a model problem in nonlinear wave propagation. We consider the one-dimensional form of the viscous Burgers equation [41,42] under the influence of time-periodic disturbances. From this problem, we aim to learn as much as we can about modeling the subgrid-scale dynamics due to local acceleration, convection and diffusion. Throughout the years, Burgers equation has become a popular testbed for CFD algorithms due to its relative simplicity and close resemblance to the Navier–Stokes [41–46]. For example, in order to test the numerical properties of a time-spectral method, Maple and his colleagues [47] explored solutions to Burgers equation for a set of time-periodic BCs.

Perhaps most relevant to this current paper are the works of Das and Moser [48] and Bernstein [49]. Das and Moser [48] developed OLES models for the forced Burgers equation. Bernstein [49] used an optimal prediction framework with memory (non-Markovian effects) for the unforced Burgers equation with slowly dissipating shocks. When constructing their subgrid-scale models, both Bernstein [49] and Das and Moser [48] considered the effects of subgrid-scale convection and diffusion due to the use of a coarse spatial grid. When included in the simulations, their models were found to improve predictions for the velocity and energy spectra. To the authors' knowledge, however, the effects of subgrid-scale accelerations due to the use of a coarse temporal grid have not been investigated for the viscous Burgers flow. In this paper, we will develop spatial and temporal subgrid-scale models to account for the combined effects due to unresolved spatial and temporal scales.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we outline the numerical method used to investigate the viscous Burgers flow within the context of the OPSTROM framework. Then, in Section 3, we characterize the subgrid-scale dynamics for the viscous Burgers flow and construct subgrid-scale models based upon the optimal prediction formalism. With these subgrid-scale models, we will investigate the performance of several optimal ROM variants (standard ROM, OPTROM, OPSROM or OPSTROM) for simulation of the viscous Burgers flow with a conventional finite-difference scheme and a coarse computational grid in both space and time. Concluding remarks are offered in Section 4.

In this section, we present the nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) which governs a viscous Burgers flow in one spatial dimension. Large-amplitude disturbances will be applied in the form of a time-periodic boundary condition (BC). The governing PDE for the viscous Burgers flow will then be modified for under-resolved simulation with the OPSTROM framework by deriving models for the subgrid-scale dynamics, both in continuous and discrete form. The modified PDE will be discretized for FRS and ROM simulations with conventional finite-difference schemes in both space and time.

Large-amplitude flow disturbances are implemented via a Dirichlet-type BC at the x=0 inflow location. At the x=L outflow location, we specify a transparent (or non-reflective [50]) Neumann-type BC:

We presume that it may be necessary or convenient to discretize the governing equations with a coarse computational grid in both space and time, and as a result, significant discretization errors may occur. If statistical information is known a priori about the subgrid-scale dynamics and their interactions with the resolved dynamics, it can be used to improve the accuracy of the solution. Such a method will be outlined in the following sections. First, we demonstrate the manner in which subgrid-scale dynamics arise in the governing equations using basic filtering concepts.

Under-resolved solutions can be considered filtered representations of the true solution, u, as depicted in Fig. 1
                        . Similar to what is done for LES of turbulent flows, the true signal u can be decomposed into filtered

                        The system in (10) represents the modified PDE for the viscous Burgers flow. We refer to the total residual field τ as the subgrid-scale dynamics term [36–39]. The α component contains subgrid time scales and is referred to as the subgrid-scale acceleration term, whereas the γ component contains subgrid spatial scales and is referred to as the (mass-normalized) subgrid-scale force term. To align with the fluids literature [11], we refer to the individual components of γ as the subgrid-scale convection and diffusion terms, respectively. The subgrid-scale acceleration term has historically been neglected in previous works on OLES [48,49]. In this work, we consider the standard ROM, OPTROM, OPSROM and OPSTROM variants. The effect of filtering the Neumann-type BC is ignored.

It should be noted at this point that standard ROMs ignore the residual terms in (10). Closure is neglected as the following equations are solved for instead:

                        While for some applications the solution to (11) may be acceptable, for others the solution to (11) may lead to intolerable errors, especially if the problem contains many interacting scales. When the residual terms in (10) are truncated, the filtering operation used to construct the ROM is no longer consistent with the filter relating u to

If the exact expression for 
                           τ
                         is known, the filtered solution

                         can be obtained by solving the modified PDEs in (10). For most systems, however, it is not feasible [27] to derive an exact expression for 
                           τ
                         due to its functional dependence on the true solution, u. Our approach is to evolve a simpler form of the governing equations instead of the true form in (10) by removing the functional dependence of 
                           τ
                         on u. This can be done by modeling 
                           τ
                         as a function of the filtered solution, 
                           
                              
                                 u

                        . If we let 
                           M
                         represent the model for 
                           τ
                        , we can rewrite (10) as

                        Choosing a model of the form in (13) is the premise of first-order optimal prediction [27]. No other model can be more accurate (in a mean square sense). Note that our selection of

                         in (14) may include any subset of

                        , and any portion of the time history from zero to present time, t. Besides introducing a model and following the mean-square error minimization approach [26,27], derivation of the result in (13) can also be motivated [28] by choosing to remove the functional dependence of 
                           τ
                         on u by simply taking the mean of (10) conditional on

                         is often impractical [28], in which case the closure problem becomes one of estimating

                         and

                         are correlated in space and time, respectively. It is possible then to predict

                         if 
                           M
                         is chosen to be some function of

                        . The stronger the correlation (positive or negative), the more accurately one should be able to estimate

                        . The most general form of such a model can be written [33] in the form of a Volterra series expansion with respect to

                        . The support for such a model may span the entire spatial domain in 
                           Ω

In this study, we employ two discretization schemes: one for fully resolved simulations and the other for reduced order modeling with a coarse computational grid in space and time. Spatial derivatives for both schemes are approximated using second-order accurate central differencing for 
                           x

                         with backward differencing at the x=1 outflow boundary. Time derivatives for the first scheme are approximated with an explicit fourth-order accurate Runge–Kutta scheme. The fully discretized equations of motion are denoted as Runge–Kutta center-space (RKCS) [46]. The explicit RKCS scheme is efficient for fully resolved simulations, but suffers from numerical instability when taking coarse timesteps. In this work, a fine computational grid with

To allow for a coarse temporal grid (and associated computational savings), we also employ an implicit first-order accurate backward differencing scheme. The fully discretized equations of motion are denoted as backward-time center-space (BTCS) [46]. Standard ROM solutions to (11) with the BTCS scheme can be evolved by

                        Our choice of the implicit BTCS scheme is based upon several appealing features such as unconditional stability, provided the iterative root finding scheme used to solve the system is able to converge at each timestep. In order to solve the nonlinear algebraic equations in (15) and (16), we employ a Newton–Raphson (NR) scheme with a numerical Jacobian and a banded matrix solver. A coarse computational grid with

The filtering operation used to derive the subgrid-scale dynamics can be tailored to the chosen ROM. To demonstrate, we consider a scenario in which the analyst has a priori knowledge of the FRS solution, which we assume to be equivalent to the true solution, u. Any filter may be selected arbitrarily by the analyst in order to produce 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 ˜
                              
                           
                        . One filter in particular, however, would result in 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 ˜
                              
                           
                         being equivalent to the a posteriori result of the ROM if the discretization errors could (hypothetically) be removed. We consider such a filter to be consistent with the ROM, as shown in Fig. 3
                        . The choice of any other filter is said to be inconsistent with the ROM.

Finite-difference (FD) schemes produce space–time-limited signals, which have finite support in physical space and infinite support in the Fourier domain [51]. A consistent filter for a ROM based on a FD scheme should produce a signal that coincides with the FRS result at every spatial node and timestep. A comb-type sampling filter [51] should then be applied, in which case the filtered states

To illustrate application of a consistent comb-type sampling filter, we first consider the local acceleration term in (10). In this work, a temporal ROM is constructed with a first-order accurate backward FD scheme. The subgrid-scale acceleration in (10) then becomes

                         eliminates all discretization errors associated with the temporal FD scheme. The choice of any other filter for a FD scheme would introduce additional forms of error.

Similarly, in this work, a spatial ROM is constructed for the convection and diffusion terms in (10) with a second-order accurate central FD scheme. With a comb-type sampling filter, the subgrid-scale convection and diffusion terms in (10) then become

Other filtering operations are conceivable. Finite-element (FE), finite-volume (FV), and spectral schemes can be treated in a similar manner. Depending on the application, the analyst may consider an inconsistent filter to be appropriate. Regardless of the ROM, the chosen filter should represent the desired a posteriori result when applied to the FRS solution.

The accuracy of the subgrid-scale model in (19) depends on the estimation coefficients. It can be shown [38] that the mean-square error between the conditional average in (13) and the estimate in (19) is minimized when the following system of stochastic equations are satisfied:

                         in (20) may be interpreted as inputs required for model construction. These inputs can be evaluated numerically once the true solution is obtained and a filter is chosen for the ROM. The mean operator 
                           〈
                           ·
                           〉
                         is to be calculated over the spatiotemporal domain of interest. Once the moments are obtained, the estimation coefficients can be found by solving the linear algebraic system of equations in (20).

The size of the linear algebraic system in (20) depends on the spatial stencil M
                        
                           N
                        , temporal stencil M
                        
                           T
                        , and the order of the approximation. While it is reasonable to expect that increasing the number of these parameters will lead to a better prediction for 
                           τ
                        , the presence of distant and poorly correlated data can sometimes worsen the estimate [19]. Moreover, no guarantees can be made regarding whether or not the equations we obtain in (20) can be solved [28]. Certain models may not be realizable.

In general, the subgrid-scale model and its estimation coefficients in (19) may vary as a function of the ICs, BCs, location x

                         in (20). In theory, a unique subgrid-scale model could be derived for every conceivable set of parameters in a simulation. However, to be useful for large-scale systems with spatiotemporal dependency, we must explore methods to reduce the amount of inputs needed for model construction. In this context, the utility of a subgrid-scale model can be enhanced when the required inputs in (20) display at least some of the following properties: (i) temporal homogeneity, (ii) spatial homogeneity, (iii) ergodicity, and (iv) a functional dependence which can easily be characterized with respect to the system parameters [38,40,52]. Such properties will be explored in the following section when constructing subgrid-scale models for the viscous Burgers flow.

Finally, several variants of the optimal ROM framework are conceivable depending on which terms in the subgrid-scale dynamics are deemed important. We refer to these variants as follows: (i) standard ROM, which completely neglects the effects due to subgrid spatial and time scales, (ii) OPTROM, which accounts for the subgrid temporal structure in α, (iii) OPSROM, which accounts for the subgrid spatial structure in γ, and (iv) OPSTROM, which accounts for the complete subgrid spatiotemporal structure in τ. The OPSROM variant is analogous to OLES for turbulent flows [18–22], whereas the OPTROM and OPSTROM variants were first proposed by the authors [36–39]. All four variants will be investigated for the viscous Burgers flow.

                     . The FRS solutions will then be filtered, and the multi-point moments required as inputs for model construction will be calculated directly from the filtered FRS data. With this information, the required moments will then be estimated (or interpolated) in the continuous forcing parameter space. Based upon the findings of this characterization, subgrid-scale models will be constructed for each of the four optimal ROM variants, including standard ROM, OPSROM, OPTROM and OPSTROM. The performance of these subgrid-scale models will then be investigated in order to determine which optimal ROM variant is most reliable for simulation of the viscous Burgers flow when the computational grid is under-resolved in both space and time. We will consider simulations for two sets of flow parameters, one for which the model inputs are calculated directly from an FRS solution, and another for which the model inputs are obtained efficiently by means of estimation. We will post-process the solutions in order to determine how well the spatial and temporal statistical properties are preserved.

Due to the parabolic nature of the governing PDE and time-periodic inflow BCs for this problem, all initial flow configurations evolve to the same steady-state solution for a given set of flow parameters when the flow is given enough time to convect downstream. Therefore, temporal homogeneity is an excellent assumption for the multi-point (in both space and time) moments in (20) when the mean operator is taken over one period of steady-state oscillation. This is due to the fact that the mean of a time-periodic function is invariant when the domain of integration is evaluated over one period. Moreover, since there exists one steady-state solution to which all initial flow configurations evolve, the system can also be considered ergodic for the purpose of model construction [38,40,52].

The multi-point moments do vary significantly in space, however, as shown in Figs. 4–6
                        
                        
                         for a representative flow with Re=100 and St=3. Observe in Fig. 4 that the mean of

                         grows as the flow convects downstream, whereas the second moment is relatively homogeneous and the higher-order moments of the flow dissipate. In addition to the single-point moments shown in Fig. 4, multi-point moments amongst

                         are required subgrid-scale models. For brevity, however, it is sufficient to state through observation that the multi-point moments amongst

In order to construct models for OPTROM, we require knowledge of multi-point moments amongst the velocity field and subgrid-scale acceleration, as shown in Fig. 5. Observe that the mean of α

                           n
                         are relatively large upstream. As the flow convects downstream, however, the subgrid time scales become less important and the moments decay. The information shown in Fig. 4 is all that needs to be known about α in order to construct a spatially heterogeneous model for OPTROM with a linear stochastic estimate on a three-point stencil.

For OPSROM, we require knowledge of multi-point moments amongst the velocity field and the (mass-normalized) subgrid-scale force, as shown in Fig. 6. Observe that the mean of γ

                           n
                         is greatest upstream where convection is dominant the spatial scales are most complex. The multi-point moments amongst

                                       ˜

                         and γ
                        
                           j
                        
                        
                           n
                         display an even greater degree of functional dependence on the spatial location. Such variation all but necessitates the use of spatially heterogeneous subgrid-scale models. The information shown in Fig. 6 is all that needs to be known about γ in order to construct a heterogeneous model for OPSROM with a quadratic stochastic estimate with diagonal coefficients on a three-point spatial stencil. Previous research in OLES [20,21,49] has suggested that quadratic estimates may be necessary to accurately model subgrid-scale convection terms.

The next step is to characterize the functional dependence of the multi-point moments with respect to the flow parameters. Due to the previous findings, temporal homogeneity of the required moments is assumed, but spatial dependence is preserved. A local bilinear interpolation scheme is used to estimate the moments in the continuous flow parameter space

                         in Figs. 8 and 9 also display a similar type of functional dependence with respect to the flow parameters. The subgrid-scale accelerations in Fig. 8 appear to be significant unless the flow is heavily damped (
                           Re
                           →
                           0
                        ) and slowly fluctuating (
                           St
                           →
                           0
                        ). The (mass-normalized) subgrid-scale forces in Fig. 9 are also greatest for large Reynolds numbers, but seem to be affected less by the Strouhal number.

In order to determine the accuracy of the estimated moments in Figs. 7–9, one additional FRS solution is obtained for a new set of flow parameters (Re=50 and St=2.25). Several of the multi-point moments required for model construction are compared in Table 1
                        ; the moments are obtained by means of estimation (as in Figs. 7–9) and direct calculation from the FRS solution for Re=50 and St=2.25. As shown in Table 1, the estimated moments amongst the velocity are generally 95% accurate whereas the moments amongst the subgrid-scale force and acceleration are found to be 80% accurate. We deem these to be good results, considering the additional forms of uncertainty embedded within the stochastic estimate.

The moments shown in Figs. 7–9 can also be tabulated for different computational grids by filtering the FRS data with different 
                           Δ
                           x

Finally, we note that in order to characterize the subgrid-scale dynamics in this section, we have sacrificed some computational expense (in order to perform sixteen FRS simulations) with the intent that the subgrid-scale models may be valuable for future analyses with under-resolved simulations. As an alternative to FRS data, future work may consider moment reconstruction from experimental data, theory [53], or a combination of multiple sources.

One of the objectives of this study is to determine which of the terms representing the subgrid-scale dynamics are important for under-resolved simulations. As such, we model individually α for simulations with OPTROM and γ for simulations with OPSROM. When used in conjunction, the models for α and γ account for the complete subgrid-scale spatial and temporal statistical structure, and can be used for simulations with OPSTROM.

The remaining solutions in Fig. 10 are obtained with various types of optimal subgrid-scale models, all of which are heterogeneous in space and homogeneous in time. The first type of model, OPSROM, is similar to those used in OLES [18–22] in the sense that it considers only the subgrid-scale convection and diffusion terms, which arise due to the use of a coarse spatial grid. This particular OPSROM model is based upon a quadratic stochastic estimate with diagonal coefficients and a central three-point spatial stencil (uses information from

                         to predict α). The results in Fig. 10 indicate that the OPTROM model reduces the numerical damping associated with a coarse timestep, but errors are still present as the downstream velocities are under-predicted. Moderate improvement can be seen in the spatial and temporal spectra in Fig. 10(c) and (d), particularly in the lowest wave numbers.

When used individually, the OPTROM and OPSROM models in Fig. 10 appear to be insufficient for eliminating the discretization errors due to a coarse computational grid in space and time, which suggests that the subgrid spatial and temporal scales are both important and need to be considered. To this end, the OPSTROM model in Fig. 10 is designed to account for the subgrid spatial and temporal structures. The OPSTROM solution is in excellent agreement with the FRS result throughout the entire spatial domain. Enrichment can be seen in virtually all modes of the spatial and temporal spectra.

Another objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of models based upon estimated moments. In the previous section, it was found that the estimated moments constructed in this study are fairly accurate for a representative set of flow parameters (see Table 1). Now we will evaluate the performance of such models based upon the information in Figs. 7–9.

                        . Again, the standard ROM solution appears to be over-damped as the flow convects downstream. Two different types of OPSTROM models are compared in Fig. 11. The first model is calculated directly from the FRS solution, whereas the second model is constructed from estimated moments. Both models are found to significantly improve the accuracy solutions throughout the entire domain. Enrichment can be seen in virtually all modes of the spatial and temporal spectra.

As stated in the Introduction, the subgrid-scale models for OPSTROM are formulated to preserve the underlying spatiotemporal statistical structure of the nonlinear dynamical system. Thus, as a final result, we explore the extent to which the subgrid-scale moments are actually preserved for the viscous Burgers flow. Compared in Table 2
                         are representative multi-point moments amongst the velocities for the FRS, standard ROM and OPSTROM solutions from Fig. 11. Moments for the OPSROM and OPTROM simulations are included for reference. Compared to the FRS results, the OPSTROM moments in Table 2 are typically five times more accurate than those obtained with the standard ROM. Note that the errors (stated in parenthesis) are generally greater for the higher-order moments.

Numerical solutions for the viscous Burgers equation with a time-periodic boundary condition were investigated within the context of a newly developed framework for nonlinear dynamical systems called optimal spatiotemporal reduced order modeling (OPSTROM). The OPSTROM framework is a data-driven methodology for the synthesis of ROMs for multiscale problems, and can be used to expedite numerical simulations (by coarsening the computational grid in space and time) while maintaining reliable predictions for the quantities of interest (by preserving the underlying spatiotemporal statistical structure of the nonlinear dynamical system). In the context of nonlinear continuum mechanics, the OPSTROM framework relies on the concept of embedding subgrid-scale models into the governing equations to account for the effects due to unresolved spatial and temporal scales. Traditional ROMs neglect these effects, whereas most multiscale ROMs include such information in a way that is inconsistent with the underlying spatiotemporal statistical structure of the nonlinear dynamical system. The process of constructing subgrid-scale models for OPSTROM requires inputs in the form of multi-point statistical moments amongst certain subgrid-scale dynamical quantities, which, in theory, can be obtained from fully resolved simulation (FRS), experimental data, or reconstructions from multiple sources. These models are formulated to provide optimal predictions for the quantities of interest as they are based upon principles of mean-square error minimization, conditional expectations, and stochastic estimation.

Several variants of the OPSTROM framework are possible, including (i) standard ROM, which completely neglects the effects due to subgrid spatial and temporal scales, (ii) OPSROM, which only accounts for the effects due to subgrid spatial scales and is similar in concept to the numerical method known as large-eddy simulation (LES) for turbulent flows, (iii) OPTROM, which only accounts for the effects due to subgrid time scales and is unique from what is typically done in LES, and (iv) OPSTROM, which accounts for the complete subgrid-scale spatiotemporal structure. In this paper, we aimed to determine which of the four ROM variants is most reliable for under-resolved simulation of the viscous Burgers flow with a conventional finite-difference scheme and a coarse computational grid in both space and time.

Characterization of the subgrid-scale dynamics for the viscous Burgers flow revealed spatial variation of the multi-point statistical moments required for model construction, and a functional dependence that can easily be characterized with respect to the flow parameters (Reynolds number and Strouhal number). These observed properties enabled efficient construction of spatially heterogeneous subgrid-scale models with a relatively small amount of FRS data (sixteen solutions). We investigated the performance of these models by comparing solutions obtained with several of the optimal ROM variants (for selected stencils) to the FRS results. The OPSROM model was found to be insufficient for error reduction as the velocity field appeared to be overdamped as the flow convected downstream. The OPTROM model was also found to be insufficient for error reduction, although the effects due to numerical damping were apparently reduced. However, when the models were used in conjunction, the resulting OPSTROM solutions were found to be in excellent agreement with the FRS results. Enrichment was found in both the spatial and temporal spectral modes. OPSTROM models based upon estimated moments were found to be five times more accurate than a comparable standard ROM in preserving the underlying spatial and temporal statistical structures.

Based on the observed performance of the models in this paper, it appears as though the OPSTROM framework could potentially be used to improve the ways in which subgrid-scale models are constructed for turbulent flows governed by the Navier–Stokes equations (by accounting for the combined effects due to unresolved spatial and temporal scales) and thus improve the computational efficiency and reliability of the associated numerical simulations.
