                  An element has been developed for the analysis of laminated composite plates. The element is capable of representing high orders of displacement using very few degrees of freedom. The respective orders of deflection, rotation, moment and shear have been preserved through scrupulous choice of field variables. The element is found to have a correct rank and is free from shear locking. Performance of the element has been tested in a wide range of problems which indicate that combining all these features can help to achieve great accuracy at reduced computation cost.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Composite laminates are being increasingly used in a number of areas including aerospace, automobile, nuclear, marine, civil and biomedical engineering. This is mainly due to their high stiffness and strength-to-weight ratios and other superior material characteristics such as long fatigue life and ability to manipulate fibre orientations to meet design requirements. However, composite laminates are at the same time significantly weak in shear, which demand special attention on the part of designers. A clear understanding of the structural behaviour of laminated plates is thus needed to fully utilise their potential in the design of various engineering components. Finite Element is one of the most successful analytical tools used in the analysis of laminated composite plates. The research on simple, accurate and efficient finite elements for the analysis of laminated composite plates has been receiving much attention in recent years. A large number of finite element models have been developed for the analysis of laminated composite plates in the last two decades [1]. Still, ‘no single element’ has been reported [2,3] to have ‘emerged as the so-called “best”' or ‘comprehensive enough for the entire range of applications.’ This provides the background and motivation for the present research paper in framing a general purpose, efficient and elegant element.

The classical laminated plate theory (CLPT) does not account for the transverse shear deformation, and is therefore inadequate for modelling composite plates. Moreover, a CLPT model requires C
                     1 continuity to be satisfied across inter-element boundaries, which proves to be computationally expensive. When using a first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) like Reissner–Mindlin's theory (RMT) to model plates, a linear variation of shear across the plate thickness is assumed, and the continuity requirements are brought down to C
                     0. An additional shear correction factor may be introduced to account for the discrepancy between the actual parabolic variation of shear and the postulates of RMT. Higher-order plate theories of course provide a slightly improved accuracy, but at the cost of a significant increase in computation time. Thus, RMT is known to give the best compromise between economy, simplicity, and accuracy in prediction of the global response of composite plates [4]. The displacement type finite element models based on FSDT suffer from the problem of shear locking. This is primarily due to the inconsistent and low order interpolation of different displacement variables. Studies with higher order shape functions have been able to solve the problem considerably, and have been a topic of much interest to researchers for the last three decades [4].

The major research work presented in this paper is centred on the development of a new element for the analysis of laminated composite plates. In a previous article by Sheikh and Dey [5] an element was developed for the analysis of thick isotropic plates. A similar concept has been applied here to design a new element for the analysis of laminated composite plates. The element is a displacement type model based on Reissner–Mindlin's theory. The proposed element has an arbitrary triangular shape with seven nodes in the initial stage—three at the vertices, three at the mid-sides, and a seventh node at the centroid of the element (Fig. 1
                     (a)). Each of the six external nodes has five degrees of freedom: two inplane displacements u and v, a transverse deflection w, and two rotations of the normal θ
                     
                        x
                      and θ
                     
                        y
                     . The central node is allotted w, θ
                     
                        x
                      and θ
                     
                        y
                      as its degrees of freedom, which are later eliminated by static condensation to give the element a simple and elegant form (Fig. 1(b)). This results in a thirty-degree-of-freedom element in the final stage with six nodes, each containing the five usual degrees of freedom. The field variables taken in the formulation of the element are the translations u, v, w, and the rotations of a normal due to shear γ
                     
                        x
                      and γ
                     
                        y
                     . While u and v are represented by complete quadratic polynomials, a complete fourth order polynomial is used to approximate w, whereas γ
                     
                        x
                      and γ
                     
                        y
                      are represented by complete linear polynomials. The basic underlying concept behind the proposed element lies in choosing γ
                     
                        x
                      and γ
                     
                        y
                      as independent field variables, while using the conventional degrees of freedom θ
                     
                        x
                      and θ
                     
                        y
                      at the nodes. The consequent advantages are manifold. Firstly the deflection and rotation fields are represented by complete fourth and third order polynomials respectively, which warranties a high order of accuracy. Secondly, the rotation of the normal due to bending is not modelled separately, but obtained by differentiating the deflection; this not only increases the accuracy of the model, but also reduces the computation time by involving less degrees of freedom. Most importantly, a consistent order of polynomials representing deflection, rotation, moment and shear helps to avert shear locking—a crucial drawback of most Mindlin elements. As a backup, the element passes the patch test for moment, shear and twist, and has been noted to be free from spurious modes. Finally, a large number of examples solved with the element proves its efficiency and performance in a wide variety of conditions.

A comprehensive summary of the finite element models that have been developed for the analysis of laminated composite plates in the past few decades may be found in some of the survey articles [1–3]. However, a few representative works are being discussed in this section.

Reddy [6] in his excellent paper has presented classical and shear deformation theories up to third order and analysed different types of linear and non-linear problems such as bending, natural vibration and stability of composite laminates by finite element method. He solved the problems considering various boundary conditions and lamination schemes. In this paper he has also discussed the effect of shear locking and symmetry conditions of the plate. It has been shown that the use of quarter plate models can introduce significant errors into the solution of certain laminates. Sengupta [7] has developed a shear deformable locking-free triangular element to study the bending behaviour of thick and thin plates of various boundary conditions subjected to uniformly distributed as well as concentrated loads. The performance of the element was found to be excellent. Liu and Lin [8] have proposed a four noded, sixteen degree of freedom, conforming quadrilateral plate bending element in which the element geometry is represented by bi-linear polynomials, while the displacement functions are in terms of modified bi-cubic polynomials satisfying energy orthogonality. In this formulation the usual approach of expressing transverse displacements and rotations by separate expansions is not allowed. They have presented results for square, rhombic and circular plates. It is reported that though improved results have been obtained for the deflections and moments at the mid-point of square plates, the clamped edge moments are not so well. Kabir [9] has developed a shear locking-free robust isoparametric three noded triangular finite element for the bending analysis of fibre reinforced plates. A shear correction term has been introduced into the finite element formulation. He has presented numerical results for a simply supported square and skew plates with cross-ply laminates subjected to uniformly distributed transverse loads. Ali [10] has investigated the effect of pertinent finite element parameters on the analysis of composite structures. He developed an optimum finite element model for the analysis of automotive components and experimentally verified the predicted stress resultants. Liu [11] has developed the two dimensional quadrature element method (DQEM) to study the bending analysis of symmetric cross-ply laminates using the FSDT. A laminated plate with different discontinuities in loading, geometry, material and boundary conditions has been first divided into simple plate elements and the differential quadrature method has been used on each. Aurucchio et al. [12] have developed a mixed finite element for laminated composite plates by simply coupling a standard membrane element for in-plane displacements with a robust method for plate bending problem, where both the elements were originally developed for homogeneous materials. Haldar [13] has used a triangular element with 16 nodes where the field variables are in-plane displacements (u, v), transverse displacement w, and bending rotations (θ
                     
                        x
                     , θ
                     
                        y
                     ).The transverse displacement w has been represented by a complete fourth order polynomial and the other field variables by complete third order polynomials. The element has a large number of nodes with varying degrees of freedom at each node, which makes the element somewhat unattractive in implementation. Civalek [14] has proposed a discrete singular convolution (DSC) method for the vibration and buckling analysis of composite plates. An arbitrary four-noded quadrilateral element has been mapped onto a square domain for simplicity of computation. Moleiro et al. [15] have developed mixed least-squares finite element models for laminated composite plates by considering generalised displacements and stress resultants as independent variables using high order C
                     0 basis functions. This yields a symmetric positive-definite system of linear equations of correct rank, and the numerical examples show no signs of shear locking. Könnö and Stenberg [16] report a model for the laminated composite plate problem based on Reissner–Mindlin and first order lamination theories by using stabilised MITC finite elements. The model is applied to investigate the effect of boundary conditions on the small scale deformation in the paper cockling problem. Mulcahy and McGuckin [17] describe a method for incorporating shear flexibility into existing three-noded triangular thin plate elements. Shear locking is shown to be absent and the element having a correct rank if the parent element can satisfy some necessary conditions. The convergence characteristics of the resulting element are reported to be similar to the parent element. Castellazzi and Krysl [18] present a nine-noded quadrilateral displacement-based element using bi-quadratic interpolations of the transverse displacement and rotations, which is shown to be a development of the NIPE formulation, improving its performance in extreme mesh distortions. Pajand et al. [19] have proposed a thirteen-noded triangular element with parabolic variation of transverse shear strains across the thickness of the plate. The normal-derivative of the transverse deflection (
                        ∂
                        w
                        /
                        ∂
                        n
                     ) is taken as independent degree of freedom which is tested to increase the effectiveness of the element.

The formulation of the element is based on Reissner–Mindlin's theory, where the effect of shear deformation has been taken into consideration. The middle plane of the plate is taken as the reference plane which is considered to be the xy plane before bending. In CLPT a line segment normal to the mid-surface of the plate before bending, as illustrated in Fig. 2
                     (a), remains straight and normal to the deformed mid-surface after bending, as shown in Fig. 2(c). This idealisation works well for thin isotropic plates, but the solution obtained by this method starts departing from the actual results as the effect of shear deformation becomes significant. In the actual case the normal usually assumes a curved configuration as shown in Fig. 2(b). In Reissner–Mindlin's theory, the normal is assumed to remain straight, but inclined at an angle

                              y
                           
                        
                      with the transverse direction (Fig. 2(d)), where θ
                     
                        y
                      is the total rotation, γ
                     
                        y
                      is the rotation due to shear of the normal projected on the yz plane, and w is the transverse displacement. The discrepancy introduced in approximating the parabolic profile of the normal with a straight line may be accounted for by multiplying the transverse shear rigidities with a shear correction factor. In addition to the above, the following general assumptions are also made.
                        
                           •
                           The material of the plate follows Hooke's Law.

The transverse displacement of the plate is small compared to its thickness.

The transverse normal stress is negligible compared to the in-plane normal stress.

The five field variables are displacement components taken at the reference plane. Among them the in-plane displacements u and v are represented by complete second order polynomials, the transverse displacement w is approximated by a complete fourth order polynomial, while the shear rotations γ
                     
                        x

It is quite interesting that the results on bending of composite plates available in the literature are mostly for rectangular plates and simply supported boundary conditions. The variation of load is also taken as sinusoidal, which, though not usually encountered in practice, simplifies the integrals involved in an analytical solution. However, to assess the performance of an element, it is necessary to solve examples involving different shapes and boundary conditions, load distribution and ply orientation. The following examples include composite plates of different shapes, with symmetric and anti-symmetric laminates having cross-ply and angle-ply arrangements. The section triggers with a preliminary test for spurious modes, and patch tests for uniform moment, shear and twist in Examples 0–3. The loading is taken to be uniformly distributed in most cases, though there are results with a point load Example 3 and sinusoidal distribution Example 4. A convergence study is made in Example 5 with a wide range of mesh sizes and an extensive variation of thickness ratio. A gradually refining mesh illustrates monotonic convergence of the results, and a 12×12 mesh may be recommended for a general problem. An extremely low thickness ratio (
                        h
                        /
                        a
                        =
                        0.0001
                     ) warrants the absence of shear locking in the element---a grave concern to most finite element developers. Different boundary conditions are taken in Example 7, and different shapes of the plate are explored in Examples 8 (skew) and 9 (triangular plate). Appropriate results obtained for free edge boundaries and different skew angles suggest that the element works well for these diverse conditions.

For each example, deflection and/or moments are calculated at suitable points on the plate, and the results are compared with published results to check the accuracy of obtained solutions. A quarter plate is analysed wherever possible, though in order to maintain consistency in the results equivalent mesh sizes for a full plate are reported in all the tables. The shear correction factor is taken as 5/6 unless specified in some specific case. Though the individual layers have different fibre orientations (see Fig. 3
                     ), each lamina possesses the same thickness and material property. The following two materials have been used in the ensuing examples.

Test of spurious modes.

As one of the preliminary tests for an element, the eigen values of an element stiffness matrix have been computed, taking different configurations of the element and by varying the material properties. In every case the correct number of zero eigen values have been found, each corresponding to a rigid body mode. This ensures that the element is free from spurious modes.

                     . The analysis is done for different values of thickness ratio (h/a), in each of which the results exactly match with the analytical solution.

The same plate (Fig. 4) is analysed under the action of uniformly distributed transverse load p per unit length at the free edge instead of moment, keeping all other conditions unchanged. Similar to the previous case the deflection values obtained at the free edge for different thickness ratios (h/a) are presented with the analytical results in Table 2
                     . For the analytical results, the deflections due to bending deformation and shear deformation are presented separately. The shear correction factor in this case is taken to be 1.0, as the analytical solution is based on that. Table 2 shows that the deflection values obtained in the finite element analysis agree well with the analytical results (combining the contributions of bending and shear deformations). It is also clear that the finite element result is converging towards analytical result based on shear deformation with the increase of thickness ratio, where the contribution of bending deformation goes on diminishing.

A cross-ply square laminated plate, simply supported at its four sides and subjected to uniformly distributed load (u.d.l.), is analysed by the proposed element. Material 1 has been used in this example, and the analysis is done with five different mesh sizes. The study is made for anti-symmetric (0/90) and symmetric

                     (a) and (b). Comparison of the results obtained in the present study is made with those of Reddy [25] and Kabir [9]. The results obtained by Reddy are based on an analytical solution, while Kabir has analysed the plate using a three-node triangular element developed by him, and to compare the results has used an analysis package (NISA) where a four-node quadrilateral element has been used. Table 5 shows that the results obtained by the proposed element have a good accuracy and rate of convergence with mesh size. The accurate results obtained for an extremely thin plate

                     , 30° and 45°. Similar to the previous example a quarter of the plate is taken in the analysis. In all the case the thickness ratio (h/a) is taken as 0.01 and the material properties of Material 2 are used. The results obtained with the present element are presented with those of Whitney [26], Ren [27] and Turvey [28] in Table 6
                     . Whitney [26] and Ren [27] have used classical laminate theory in their analysis while Turvey [28] has taken the effect of shear deformation according to Mindlin's plate theory. The results are given in the form of deflection and bending moments at the centre of the plate. The results show that the performance of the propose element is quite good.

The elasticity coefficients corresponding to Material 2 are used in the present problem. The plate is analysed with five different mesh divisions. The deflection and bending moments obtained at the centre of the plate are presented with those of Haldar [13] in Table 7(a)–(c). The results are observed to agree well.

A skew laminated plate is analysed with the proposed element using the mesh arrangement as shown in Fig. 7
                     . The plate is simply supported at its four edges and subjected to uniformly distributed load. The properties of Material 1 are used in this example. The study is made for cross-ply (0/90/0) and angle-ply

                      arrangements taking skew angle (α) of 15°, 30° and 45° (see Fig. 7). The analysis is done with five different mesh sizes taking thickness ratio (h/a) as 0.1. As the sides BC and AD (Fig. 7) are inclined to the global axis system (x–y), the degrees of freedom of the nodes on these two sides are expressed in a local axis system (1–2) (Fig. 7) for the incorporation of boundary conditions. This is done through a coordinate transformation, which is applied at the element level. The deflection and bending moments obtained at the plate centre are presented in Table 8
                     (a)–(c) with those of Sheikh et al. [29]. The table shows that the performance of the proposed element in a skew plate problem is quite good.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

An element has been developed for the analysis of laminated composite plates. The underlying concept of the element may be traced back to an earlier work [5] on isotropic plates. The element is triangular having three nodes at the vertex and three at the mid-sides, with the displacements u, v, w, and total rotations θ
                     
                        x
                      and θ
                     
                        y
                      at each of the nodes. On one end a complete fourth order polynomial used to represent the transverse deflection w, whereas rotations due to shear γ
                     
                        x
                      and γ
                     
                        y
                      modelled as independent field variables with complete linear polynomials on the other end, preserve the respective orders of deflection, rotation, moment and shear throughout the element, and at the same time, helps to bring down the total degrees of freedom without cutting down on accuracy. Thus an extremely economic as well as accurate element is evolved, which successfully passes the patch test and shows no rigid body modes. Shear locking is also seen to be completely absent in the proposed element. A simple geometry of the element and the nodal positions warranty its ability to model plates of any shape and seamless coupling with other standard elements. Performance of the element has been investigated in a wide range of problems involving composite plates of different shapes and ply-orientations, thickness and aspect ratios, subjected to different boundary and loading conditions. The deflections and stress resultants obtained using the present element have been compared with results from other sources, which prove the efficacy and elegance of the proposed element.
