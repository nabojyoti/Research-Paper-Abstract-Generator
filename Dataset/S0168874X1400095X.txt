                  The objective of this work is to obtain an a posteriori estimate of the discretization error of a reference problem. This reference problem is a mechanical problem solved using a finite element analysis in linear elasticity. We use the constitutive relation error based estimator. The construction of admissible fields, which is a pillar of the constitutive relation error method, is revisited using a domain decomposition method.
                  The originality of the present work is the introduction of a simplifying hypothesis that leads to an approximation of the discretization error. The construction of admissible fields, which is global, is then replaced by resolution of several local problems that conduce to lower CPU costs. The key point of this domain decomposition based error estimation is the fact that no inter-subdomain communication is needed. We present and illustrate this strategy and evaluate its benefits.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the field of mechanical engineering, numerical simulation has become an indispensable tool to predict the response of a structure to various solicitations. These numerical simulations involve the use of a discretized version of an initially continuous mathematical model (finite element analysis) that leads only to an approximation of the exact solution of the reference problem. In industrial situations, the Finite Element (FE) simulations have to satisfy both requirements of quality and CPU cost. On one side, quality requirement of the simulation, which is the purpose of verification consists in evaluating the distance between the exact solution and an approximated solution of the problem. A state-of-the-art review on verification can be found in [13,1]. On the other side recent development of parallel computers brought the foreground new simulations methods to achieve better CPU Cost. In particular, Domain Decomposition Method (DDM) is a more and more used strategy to take advantage of multicore processors or multiprocessor systems.

In Parret-Fréaud et al. [19], the proposed error estimator is strongly linked to the domain decomposition finite element based simulation, and is used to control the simulation. In this work, a new domain decomposition technique is introduced to compute the Finite Element analysis error, which takes a different path by defining totally independent calculations on each sub-domains. The main interest is a gain on CPU costs, the main drawbacks are a degraded error estimation, and thus a small quality loss. Note that the origin of the Finite Element solution can be varied. In particular, whether the finite element analysis can be performed elements using a domain decomposition method or not, the method developed here applies.

The objective of this paper is to illustrate that the quality loss is widely acceptable in a practical use. Section 2 reviews the equations of the reference problem and associated discretization and Section 3 reviews the constitutive relation error method and a technique for building admissible fields. Recovery of the admissible stress using a domain decomposition approach is introduced in Section 4. Sections 4 and 5 present some results obtained using these techniques.

                        ) is called the discretization error. This error is due mainly to the approximation concerning the equilibrium equations, the spatial discretization of the geometry or the approximation concerning the loading.

For the purpose of dimensioning the structure, it is important to quantify that error and, if possible, to obtain an upper bound. A global measure of the error is defined by

                         is reviewed in Section 3.2. The error in constitutive relation satisfies the Prager Synge relation Prager and Synge [21] which leads to the following upper bound:

                        This upper bound of the global error can be used to obtain bounds of the local quantities thanks to the introduction of a dual problem, see Becker and Rannacher [3]. The contributions of this error can also be used to perform an adaptative mesh refinement, see Florentin et al. [5].

                                  has been calculated, the field of the admissible stresses is built element by element. Analytical methods can be used, see Ladevèze and Pelle [13]. One can also use a numerical method. For example, in Babuska et al. [2], it is showed that the construction of the stresses in each element through the resolution of a higher-order finite element calculation leads to good results. Thus, one has an implicit link between stress

                                 where l is a linear mapping which corresponds to the resolution of an elastic problem for each element. The details of the construction of l can be found in [6].

The proposed approach presented here shows that the method proposed in Florentin et al. [6] can be approximated using an efficient strategy based on a domain decomposition method.

To lower the CPU cost, the error estimation is computed using a technique of domain decomposition. Let consider a partition of

                        Constitutive Relation Error based estimator requires admissible fields construction. Because the construction is global on 
                           Ω
                        , building such an admissible field is the main difficulty of the method. For example, if one considers 2 adjacent subdomains Ω
                        
                           i
                         and Ω
                        
                           j
                        , the stress vector or traction must be continuous through the interface to be admissible. The construction of an admissible stress field is necessarily global, the optimal path to construct it is developed in Florentin et al. [6] and consists in minimizing a global function defined on 
                           Ω
                        . The main disadvantage of this method is the CPU cost.

Different ideas have been proposed to build such admissible stress field independently on each subdomain. For example, in [10,17], the buildings are purely computed on local sets of adjacent elements. The main disadvantage is that the resulting fields is far from the optimal one. On the other hand, these approaches are easily computable on parallel computers (Figs. 1 and 2
                        
                        ).

The approach proposed here is based on a domain decomposition where each term

                           i
                        . This method is then easy to compute using parallel computers. The results are very close of those obtained with the optimal method.

The idea is to construct admissible fields for Child Problems defined on each subdomain Ω
                        
                           i
                        . Then we estimate distance between each local Child Problem and the restriction to Ω
                        
                           i
                         of the reference problem solution.

The studied domain is a rectangular plate with uniformly distributed holes. The structure is clamped on both right and left sides and submitted to a distributed force on the upper side, see Fig. 3
                     .

The structure is meshed with 6 refinement levels denoted N10 to N60 hereinafter. This corresponds to a number of Degree Of Freedom (DOF) denoted n

                         corresponds to the method described in Section 4 in the particular case of a unique subdomain (i.e.

It is observed that global error

                         but is still close and have same trends. This has been already shown on others numerical example in Pavot et al. [20]. Indeed, the difference between the two estimators is due to the approximation made for prescribed forces on the edges

Remark: using the results of the comparison mentioned above (see [4,12]), one can easily conclude that

                         is greater than a ZZ estimate.

We are interested here in the study of the deterioration of the proposed method with the number of subdomains used to build error estimate and associated admissible fields. Deterioration is defined as a ratio:

                         for high levels of discretization (here N50 and N60). There is an influence for coarser discretization (N10–N40). This observation tends to highlight the fact that unsufficiently refined subdomain leads to deterioration of the global error evaluation. Here appears the principal defect in Child Problem approach, because the number of sub-domains has an influence on the result. This is the counterpart of the fact that the error can be estimated independently on each subdomain.

It is observed that even if there is an influence, it remains low (maximum 5%), which validates the method for this example were a relatively consistent number of subdomains to be used (

By nature the method is fully parallelizable and requires no exchange. Indeed, the contributions are collected on each subdomain and are added at the end. We define the dimensionless computation time by the ratio:

                        Fig. 6
                         shows, for different level of discretization (N10–N60), the evolution of 
                           C
                           (

                        . In Fig. 6, it can be seen that the method can be useful even if used in a sequential manner (i.e. 
                           C
                           <
                           1
                        ). This corresponds to sufficiently refined sub-domains, which is the case for levels N50 and N60. For coarser discretizations (N10–N40), a sequential manner on a unique processor is not interesting (i.e. 
                           C
                           >
                           1
                        ). The resolution remains naturally interesting if computed on several processors, or parallel machine.

Remark: Levels N50 and N60, which correspond to sufficiently refined subdomain correspond to both:
                           
                              •
                              sequential CPU cost saving and

quality requirements for good estimation of global error.

Remark: It is interesting to note that for coarse subdomain, constant 
                           C
                           >
                           1
                         is certainly due to time preparation of each of the subdomain data which take an important part of function cost C).

A second example is tested to verify the robustness of the method using different conditions. More specifically, a validation is performed on the quality of the method when using unregular shaped subdomains. The studied example is clamped at bottom and submitted to lateral forces, see Fig. 7

In Fig. 10, we observe that similar conclusions can be drawn at local and global levels.

The same kind of CPU cost study can be done as in Example 1. In Fig. 11
                        , one plots 
                           C

                        , defined in Eq. (37), versus n
                        
                           SD
                        .

This results extend the study carried out in Example 1 with subdomains defined irregularly. The subdomain discretization level which is coarse, in this case, conduces to 
                           C
                           >
                           1
                        , confirming the conclusions drawn in Example 1. This means that if simulations are performed sequentially on a mono-processor machine, the method is not interesting from CPU cost point of view. Nevertheless, the method remains systematically efficient in case of parallel computing. Conventionally, the speed-up S is introduced to characterize the gain when performing parallel resolution:

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This work presents an original domain decomposition based finite element error estimator. Indeed, for reasons of simplicity and of genericity, the construction of the traction on the interfaces between sub-domains is unnecessary by introducing a simplifying hypothesis. Naturally, this method is no more conservative, but extremely practical to implement, and efficient. The main inconvenience of the introduced simplifying hypothesis is to break the proved mathematical property. The developed estimator becomes then heuristics and examples Sections 4 and 5 illustrate good behavior on a reasonable set of sub-domains.

The approach is rather different from that proposed in Parret-Frèaud et al. [19], Rey et al. [22]. In this works, the idea is rather to guarantee a mathematical upper bound, the counterpart is then a necessary exchange between sub-domains. In the present work the focus is on the ease of parallelization in order to treat large models. This work constitutes a first approach. A natural continuation of this work is to consider the case of contact with and without friction. This is a direct extension, if one considers that the interfaces between sub-domains are not perfect, see Gallimard and Sassi [7]. Then, the study of composites, see e.g. Lubineau [14] and Ladeveze and Lubineau [11], might be an interesting framework for illustrating the applications of the method. Concerning the limitations of the method, it seems that the approach is difficult to extend to other classes of elastic engineering model such as hybrid local/non-local model (see e.g. [15]). On the other hand the concept of constitutive relation error is easily extendable to nonelastic behavior, the associated child problem construction also and should be presented in a forthcoming paper.
