@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Thin-walled structural components are widely used in many industries including aerospace, building, aircraft and ship-building. Due to their slenderness these types of structures are susceptible to buckling and it is important to predict their response accurately. Closed-form solution procedures for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members date back to the late nineteenth century [1–4]. However, these formulations are limited to certain boundary and loading conditions. On the other hand, numerical techniques can be used to obtain solutions that are applicable to general cases. Development of numerical techniques for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members started in early seventies, Krajcinovic [5] and Barsoum and Gallagher [6] developed displacement-based finite element formulations for flexural and lateral–torsional buckling analysis of thin-walled members.

The effect of shear deformation can gain importance in the buckling behaviour of beams especially with built-up or composite sections [7,8] or alternatively when materials with relatively low shear modulus is used such as FRP [9,10]. By modifying the kinematic assumptions of the theory of Vlasov [11], Kim et al. [12], Saade et al. [13] and recently Erkmen and Attard [14] included the effects of shear deformation for the buckling analysis of thin-walled members. Erkmen and Mohareb [15,16] included the shear deformation effects by using a complementary energy-based formulation and a correspondingly developed finite element formulation. The advantage of this formulation is that shear deformation effects can be included without modifying the basic kinematic assumptions. However, for the element of Erkmen Mohareb [16], the inter-element force equilibrium conditions have to be a-priori satisfied which complicates the assemblage procedure. On the other hand, multi-field finite elements can be used to overcome the shortcomings of both displacement based and complementary energy based formulations. A number of hybrid and mixed element models have been proposed since the early papers of Pian [17,18]. A comprehensive literature review on mixed/hybrid elements until early 1990s can be found in [19]. In particular, for geometrically nonlinear and buckling analysis of beams, hybrid/mixed finite element formulations have been proposed by Kumar et al. [20], Alsafadie et al. [21] and Santos et al. [22].

In this study, a hybrid finite element formulation is developed by using the Hellinger–Reissner functional for buckling analysis. By introducing the equilibrium and force boundary conditions as auxilary conditions, the Hellinger–Reissner functional is obtained from the complementary energy functional. Complementary energy expression for geometrically nonlinear and buckling analysis has been a subject of controversy since the works of Levinson [23] and Zubov [24], who attempted to derive a strict stress-based complementary energy formulation in terms of the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor by applying Legendre transformation to the total potential energy. Several researchers including de Veubeke [25], Koiter [26], Dill [27] and Ogden [28] pointed out that the uniqueness of the Legendre transformation cannot be guaranteed in Levinson's and Zubov's derivations. Koiter [29] adopted the Jaumann stress tensor for finite elasticity solutions and obtained the complementary energy expression for semilinear isotropic material, which can be considered as a generalization of Hooke's law in geometrically non-linear elasticity, relating the right extensional strain to the Jaumann stresses. Koiter's formulation alleviates the uniqueness issues, however, the functional is not a strict stress-based formulation and contains the rotation expressions in addition to the stress quantities. Koiter [30] also formulated a general stability criterion in terms of the Jaumann stress tensor and the rotation tensor under the assumptions of small strains, moderately small rotations, and a linearized pre-buckling state. In this work, Koiter's complementary energy formulation is adopted to derive the Hellinger–Reissner functional. Further discussions on the derivation of the complementary energy formulation for geometrically nonlinear and buckling analysis can be found in the works of Oran [31–32], and Santos et al. [33–35].

On the other hand, the benefit of the hybrid formulation is that, the resulting matrix equations consist of only the nodal values of displacements as unknowns, despite the fact that the element is formulated by a multivariable Hellinger–Reissner functional. Thus, the assemblage procedure is as simple as in the case of displacement-based elements. Also, the shear deformation effects are taken into account by using the strain energy of the shear stress field by virtue of the developed Hellinger–Reissner functional where stress resultants and displacements are independent parameters. Thus, no modification on the basic kinematic assumptions of the thin-walled beam theory is needed in order to include the shear deformation effects. The formulation captures the effects of load position by virtue of the freedom provided in the beam axis selection. Comparisons with solutions from literature and those based on shell element models are presented and an example is designated to illustrate the significance of shear deformation effect.

The paper is organised as follows; deformations and adopted stress definitions for an infinitesimal body is given in Section 2. Kinematic relations, and stress resultant definitions for the thin-walled beam theory are given in Section 3. Problem scope is introduced in Section 4. The equilibrium equations and the variational formulation are introduced in Sections 5 and 6, respectively. Section 7 develops the finite element formulation based on the adopted interpolation fields. Comparisons with existing solutions from literature and those based on shell-type analyses are presented in Section 8. Conclusions are drawn in Section 9.

Two coordinate systems are adopted. The fixed XYZ (spatial) Cartesian coordinate system (
                     Fig. 1) has the Z axis oriented along the axial direction (in the un-deformed configuration) of the beam while axes X–Y are parallel to the plane of the cross-section. The xyz (material) curvilinear coordinate system (Fig. 1) is altering with the deformation of the structure so that x, y and z coordinates of a point on the beam after deformation will be identical of those before deformation. The material coordinate system coincides with the spatial coordinate system only for the undeformed beam.

A thin-walled beam is brought from the un-deformed state to a deformed state under a reference pre-buckling load. Under the reference load, the structure will undergo a rotation tensor

The reference load is then increased by a scalar multiplier value λ so that the structure attains the state of onset of buckling. At that state, the corresponding rotation tensor, first Piola–Kirchoff stress, and Jauman stress tensors become

Finally, all field variables without a superscript ⁎ or p and those which are not preceded by Δ are generic in nature and can be applied to the pre-buckling state, to the onset of buckling, or to the final buckled configuration by changing symbols, as needed. This has been the case for all field variables appearing in Eqs. (1) through (12). For instance, by adding a ⁎ superscript to all field variables in Eq. (1), one recovers an expression for the rotation tensor in the final buckled configuration i.e.,

Flexural buckling phenomena occur when a member is subjected to axial forces and lateral torsional buckling phenomena occur when a member is subjected to loads which induce bending about the section major principal axis and the associated shear forces. The limiting condition corresponding to the buckling state under such loads is obtained through a bifurcation analysis. The presence of lateral forces inducing bending about the minor axis and the associated shear, torsion, or bimoments, would transform the problem into a non-linear force-deflection analysis. In the buckling analysis sought in the current study, such effects do not appear. Thus, the beam is subjected to axial forces, bending moments acting about the major axis and in-plane vertical forces, which do not cause any pre-buckling shear forces

                     Fig. 7a–d).

Throughout buckling, the displacements in vertical direction, moments about the major axis, associated shear force acting along the minor axis, and increment in axial force all vanish i.e., Δv=ΔM

The material is assumed to be of elastic semilinear type, which is defined by replacing the engineering stress-strain pair in linear elasticity with the Jaumann stress and right extensional strain pair in Hooke's constitutive relations. The complementary energy expression for semilinear material under finite deformations is provided by Koiter [30] as

In Eq. (50), G is the shear modulus, ν is the Poisson's ratio and V
                     0 is the volume of the un-deformed body. Linearized buckling analysis (in which pre-buckling deformations are neglected) can be performed in two steps. First; linear static analysis is performed under applied loads. Second; by using the internal forces obtained from the linear static analysis and substituting into the stability condition, an eigenvalue problem is obtained.

                        . The finite element formulation is obtained by interpolating the displacement field v and w using polynomial functions of the axial coordinate z. The element is developed by using cubic interpolation for the vertical displacement and linear interpolation for the axial displacement, i.e.

It should be noted that the stationary condition with respect to the stress resultant parameters can be written at the element level because due to the relaxation of inter-element equilibrium the nodal stress resultant parameters do not couple between the elements.

It should be noted that the stationary condition with respect to the stress resultant parameters can be written at the element level because due to the relaxation of inter-element equilibrium the nodal moment parameters do not couple between the elements.

The examples presented in this section illustrate the applicability of the proposed formulations to practical problems. The problems presented also provide an indication of the validity of the new solution in comparison to results based on shell finite element analysis solutions and other closed form or numerical solutions in literature. Two elements are developed in this study. In element BEH (Buckling Element based on Hybrid formulation), the effect of shear deformation is omitted (i.e., χ
                     −1≈0), whereas in element BEHS (Buckling Element based on Hybrid formulation including Shear deformation) the effect of shear deformation is retained. For all examples except Examples 8.1, 8.2, 8.5 and 8.7, only sixteen beam elements (BEH or BEHS, as applicable) are used to model the structures.

Alternative beam element solution methods developed in the literature are used for comparison purposes. What we call Trahair element herein is a displacement based element and it does not include the effect of shear deformation. For buckling analysis, it has two nodes with four degrees of freedom at each node including lateral displacement, out of plane rotation, angle of twist and warping degrees of freedom. The element is implemented for finite element analysis in [41]. Unless stated otherwise, sixteen Trahair's elements are used for all examples. In all models, pinned supports imply that both the translation and angle of twist are restrained (Δu=Δϕ=0) while the first derivative of lateral displacement and warping deformation are free (Δu'≠0, Δϕ'≠0). Fixed supports imply that the derivative of lateral displacement and warping deformation are prevented as well as lateral displacement and angle of twist (Δu=Δu'=Δϕ=Δϕ'=0). In addition, shell element models developed in ABAQUS commercial software using S4R shell elements are used for comparison purposes.

A simply supported column is made of a symmetric I section and is subject to uniform axial load. The column span L is 2000mm and the cross-sectional dimensions are shown in

                        . An axial load P is applied at the right end of the column at the centroid C of the cross-section. The column is modelled using the current hybrid element and the number of elements used to model the column varied from 2 to 16 elements of equal length. In 
                        
                        Tables 1 and 2, for the first (flexural) buckling mode and the second (torsional) buckling mode, respectively, the buckling load predictions based on the current hybrid formulation and Trahair's element [40] are compared with those based on ABAQUS FEA shell element model [16] and closed form solutions (which do not include shear deformation effects).

One can verify from Table 1 that Elements BEH and BEHS provide upper bound predictions for the flexural buckling modes. On the other hand, as shown in Table 2, elements BEH and BEHS provide a lower bound representation of the stiffness for torsional buckling. It is observed that the inclusion of shear deformation effect provides a more flexible representation of the column stiffness and thus slightly reduces the magnitude of the buckling load. The buckling load predictions are very close to the prediction of the ABAQUS model.

Flexural buckling of a cantilever column is calculated by Santos [35] for a span of 1m and the cross-sectional rigidity for bending was taken as 
                           E

                        kNm/m2. The analyses in [35] were made by using three different elements; LCDF is a displacement based element using linear interpolation for the axial displacement field and cubic interpolation for the transverse displacement field. LCDF element is called Trahair's element herein; LPBM is a force based element using linear interpolation for the bending moment field and constant field for the axial force; QPBM is also a force based element using quadratic interpolation for the bending moment field and constant field for the axial force. Results of Santos [35] do not consider the effects of shear deformation and therefore in 
                        Table 3, they are compared with those of BEH and the Euler's buckling formula, i.e.

                         based on the LRFD procedure are given in Column (3) of Table 4. Also, the buckling moments based on Trahair elements (sixteen elements) is provided in Column (4), while Columns (5) and (6) provide the buckling moments predicted by elements BEH and BEHS.

From Table 4, one can verify that all results are in very good agreement with the results based on ABAQUS, whose predictions are the most conservative among all while Trahair element tends to slightly overestimate the buckling moment by 5% compared to ABAQUS results. Element BEHS provides the closest predictions to ABAQUS solution. As expected, for the 8000mm span members, shear deformation effects are insignificant.

A simply supported beam with mono-symmetric cross-section is subjected to uniform bending moment as shown in 
                        Fig. 10a. Dimensions of the cross-section are shown in Fig. 10b. Material is steel. The beam is analysed for 8000mm (Case 1), and 4000mm (Case 2), spans using four type of solutions: (1) ABAQUS shell element analysis, (2) Trahair's element, (3) BEH element, and (4) BEHS element.

In BEH and BEHS models, identical results are obtained based on both orthogonal coordinates and non-orthogonal coordinates in which the location of pole, centroid, and sectorial origin can be selected anywhere on the web. The results based on ABAQUS FEA model is provided in Column 2 in Table 5. The results based on BEH and BEHS elements are provided in Columns 4 and 5 in Table 5, respectively. One can verify that the results based on BEH and BEHS are in very good agreement with those based on Trahair [40] and ABAQUS. The maximum difference between ABAQUS analysis and those based on Trahair [40] and BEH are around 9%. The example illustrates the ability of elements BEH and BEHS to successfully capture mono-symmetry effects.

The portal frame studied in [42,43] is reinvestigated here. The frames have a column height L
                        
                           c

                        =6.0 and is fixed at the two bases and laterally unsupported out of the plane of the frame. Material is steel. Two external loads P acting on the horizontal member are applied at L
                        
                           b
                        /3 from the columns. Material is steel. The cross section is W200×59. In modelling with BEH and BEHS elements the columns are divided into four, the beam is divided into six elements and the joint is assumed rigid for warping. Predicted buckling loads based on different modelling approaches are given in 
                        Table 6. It can be verified that the current hybrid formulation is in very good agreement with the ABAQUS results for which the number of degrees of freedom is 62,400.

The cantilever beam with mono-symmetric section shown in 
                        Fig. 11 is made of aluminium alloy 6063-T6 and has an elasticity modulus of E=66GPa and shear modulus of G=25GPa. The beam is under vertical load at the tip applied at top flange. In [14], the buckling load was determined as 137N. The buckling load predicted by the BEH and BEHS solutions is given in 
                        Table 7. It can be verified that the load position effect on the buckling of a mono-symmetric section can be accurately captured with sufficient number of elements.

The last example is a propped cantilever with a mono-symmetric cross-section under top flange loading as shown in 
                        Table 8 which was initially analysed by Erkmen and Mohareb [16] and used herein to illustrate the effects of shear deformation. The material properties are initially E=200GPa for the elasticity modulus and G=77GPa for the shear modulus and thus E/G ratio is 2.6 based on which the buckling load was determined by the eight element BEH solution as 9343kN. The buckling analysis based on eight element BEHS predicts 8499kN. Thus, the difference between the BEH and BEHS solutions is around 10% due to the effect of shear deformation. We acknowledge that especially when the beam is short, local buckling may interact with overall buckling and influence the behaviour of the beam. However, considerations related to local buckling is beyond the scope of the current formulation. In order capture these effects shell element models or generalized beam theory e.g., [44] can be used. In [16], by using an ABAQUS shell element model, the first mode of buckling was verified to be an overall lateral–torsional buckling mode and thus, despite a short span the beam local buckling modes did not dominate the design.

On the other hand, when the E/G ratio is increased to 26 by reducing the shear modulus ten times, which is a typical value for FRP pultruded [44–46] beams, the buckling load predictions based on the BEHS reduce from 8499kN to 4551kN (a reduction of some 47%). It should be noted that when the shear deformation effects are excluded, BEH predicts the buckling load as 8135kN which is 44% higher than 4551kN and thus a significant overestimation occurs for a beam consisting of a material with low shear modulus.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The finite element solutions developed in this study are able to accurately predict classical solutions for column flexural buckling and torsional buckling, and beam lateral torsional buckling under uniform moments and linear moment gradients for doubly symmetric and mono-symmetric sections. The current formulation captures shear deformation effects, a feature that is neglected in most available buckling solutions for thin-walled members. It was shown that conventional solutions which neglect shear deformation effects can overestimate the predicted buckling load in some cases, especially when the E/G ratio is relatively high which may be the case in practice for FRP pultruded beams. Non-colinear elements can be easily connected using the developed finite element formulation as only inter-element displacement continuity is required for the assemblage procedure.
