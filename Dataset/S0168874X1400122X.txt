                  The direct time domain analysis of five-layered damped sandwich beams subject to impulse load using the discrete Hilbert transform may lead to the unstable growth in damped time responses owing to the incorrectness of Hilbert-transformed imaginary impulse force and the insufficient time duration of applied impulse force. To resolve this problem, a time domain analysis method making use of the Hilbert transform superposition and the time duration extension is introduced in this paper. The incorrect imaginary impulse force near the end of time period, which is caused by the fact that the discrete Hilbert transform using Fourier transform considers the impulse force as a periodic function, is resolved by dividing the external impulse force into a finite number of rectangular impulses. And, the sufficient time duration of applied impulse force is estimated by a Newton–Raphson-based iterative residual method. The validity of the present method is justified from the numerical experiment for analyzing the time response of five-layered damped sandwich beam.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The damped vibration responses of complex structural dynamics such as sandwich beam structures with viscoelastic layers [1,2] are usually analyzed in either frequency or time domain. In the frequency domain analysis, the external excitation force is expressed as harmonic force so that the imaginary part is automatically defined. But, in the time domain analysis, the external excitation force is real contrary to the complex-valued dynamic equation system. In order to maintain the consistency in the complex-valued dynamic equation system, the real-valued external impulse force can be converted into an analytic force signal by defining the imaginary force signal using Hilbert transform [3–5]. Meanwhile, a state-space formulation in the modal superposition approach to solve the time response of the damped dynamic system leads to two poles which are radial symmetry in the complex plane [3]. The radial symmetry implies that one pole is stable but the other is unstable such that the standard numerical solving techniques cannot provide a successful solution because the unstable pole causes unbounded growth in the damped dynamic response. To avoid such an unbounded growth, the time-reversal technique [6,7] is used, in which the time differential equation corresponding to the unstable pole is converted to one running backwards in time.

However, the time domain analysis making use of the Hilbert transform and the time-reversal technique may lead to the incorrect damped time response owing to two problems, the incorrect Hilbert-transformed imaginary force and the insufficient time duration of applied external force. The Hilbert transform can be analytically derived according to its mathematical definition if the input force signal is expressed in a well-defined explicit function of time. However, for arbitrary input force signals, their Hilbert transforms are alternatively obtained by a combined use of Fourier (FT) and inverse Fourier transforms (IFT) according to the fundamental properties of the complex-valued strong analytical signal [5]. But, such a discrete Hilbert transform using FT and IFT may provide us the incorrect imaginary function near the end of time period because Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms consider the input force signal as a periodic function. Meanwhile, the time duration for the time domain analysis is set based on the original real-valued external force, but it may be insufficient for the imaginary external force. The Hilbert-transformed imaginary force may not be zero at the beginning even though its original real-valued external force starts with zero value, which gives rise to the incorrect unstable time response. This problem is solely owing to the fact that the time duration of complex-valued analytic force is set based on the original real-valued external force. It can be resolved by extending the time duration for the time domain analysis so that the imaginary force starts with a sufficiently small value.

As an extension of our work on the forced vibration of damped sandwich beams [8,9], the purpose of this paper is to introduce a time-duration extended Hilbert transform superposition method for the reliable impulse response analysis of five-layered damped sandwich beams in time domain. In order to resolve the above mentioned problem of the discrete Hilbert transform by a combined use of FT and IFT near the end of time period, the Hilbert transform of arbitrary external force is obtained by the superposition method. An arbitrary continuous real-valued force signal is divided into a finite number of rectangular impulses and its Hilbert transform is obtained by summing up the analytic Hilbert transforms of each rectangular impulse. Since the analytic Hilbert transform of rectangular impulse is derived by the mathematical definition of Hilbert transform, the above-mentioned discrepancy near the end of time period can completely disappear. Meanwhile, the original time duration set based on the real-valued external force is extended by a Newton–Raphson-based iteration method, based on the fact that Hilbert transform conserves the magnitude of an original input signal [5]. The difference in squared areas between the original and Hilbert-transformed functions is defined as a residual functional, and the original time duration is successively extended in both the negative and positive time directions until the relative residual satisfies the preset tolerance.

The present method is applied to analyze the time response of five-layered damped sandwich beam [10–12] in order to illustrate and validate the theoretical work. The five-layered damped sandwich beam is modeled using 2-node 8-DOF damped beam elements which are developed based on the principle of virtual work and the compatibility relation between the lateral displacement and the shear strains [9]. The complex finite element matrix equations are derived in both time and frequency domain, and the time-reversal technique is applied to the corresponding state-space formulation in the mode superposition approach. Through the numerical experiments, the validity of the Hilbert transform superposition and the time duration extension algorithm are examined, and the forced time response of five-layered damped sandwich beam is compared with those obtained by IFT and the Hilbert transform superposition method without extending the time duration.

This paper is organized as follows. The finite element approximation of the forced vibration of five-layered damped sandwich beam using 8-DOF damped beam elements is addressed in Section 2. The application of time-reversal technique for the time domain analysis of linear complex structural dynamics is briefly summarized in Section 3. The Hilbert transform superposition for defining the correct imaginary impulse force and the time-duration extension using a Newton–Raphson-based residual method are explained in Section 4. The numerical experiments for illustrating the present method are represented in Section 5 and the conclusion is made in Section 6.

It is assumed that the beam thickness is sufficiently small compared to the beam length and five layers are completely bonded so as not to allow slipping at the layer interfaces. Further assumptions are made for the analysis of the beam transverse displacement: (1) the transverse direct strains in all the five layers are small enough so that the lateral displacement is uniform across any section of the beam, (2) the longitudinal and rotary effects are negligible, (3) three metal layers obey Kirchhoff hypothesis so as not to produce transverse shear strains, and (4) two viscoelastic layers obey Kerwin assumption [13,14] so that the longitudinal direct strains are much small than the shear strains.

The beam can be either symmetric or asymmetric, and the transverse shear strains

                      in order for the consistency of the complex-valued dynamic equation system (13). One may obtain the impulse response, such as the peak dynamic displacement and the decaying characteristics, by taking the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the frequency response. But, not only such Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms become an extra job but also the converted impulse response in time domain is affected by the resolution of frequency response function (FRF). In this context, a somewhat novel direct time-domain analysis method for Eq. (13) is introduced in this paper, motivated by the fact that an arbitrary real-valued impulse force can be decomposed into a finite number of well-defined rectangular impulse signals and its imaginary part can be obtained by superposing the Hilbert transforms of those rectangular impulses. Furthermore, the resulting complex-valued analytic impulse force could provide the accurate impulse response when its time duration is appropriately extended.

(14) of motion leads to the conjugate complex eigen values, which causes the numerical instability and divergence when the time response is sought by the standard time integration schemes like the discrete-time implementation of the convolution signal [3]. In order to overcome such a numerical instability and divergence, the time-reversal technique which has been studied for a long time in acoustic and medical applications [6,7] is widely adopted.

Thus, the analytic signal of the real applied load for the forced vibration analysis of damped sandwich beam would be obtained by a combined use of discrete FT and IFT.

But, the imaginary part 
                           
                              f
                              ^
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         in analytic signal which is obtained using Eq. (28) may be different from one derived analytically using the definition of Hilbert transform (23) because the Fourier transform regards the input signal as a periodic function. In order to investigate this difference, let us consider a rectangular impulse 
                           f
                           (
                           t
                           )
                           =
                           rect

                         shown in 
                        Fig. 3(a). It is not hard to derive the Hilbert transform 
                           
                              f

                         is represented in Fig. 3(b). Where the other two Hilbert transforms are obtained using Eq. (28), one for a non-periodic single rectangular signal as shown in Fig. 3(a) and the other considering the rectangular signal as a periodic function.

It is clearly observed that the Hilbert transform obtained using the discrete FT and IFT shows the totally different curve from the analytically derived one near the end of time period. But, the Hilbert transform obtained by the discrete FT and IFT exactly coincides with one of the periodic rectangular signal, justifying that non-periodic signals are regarded as a periodic one when their analytic signals are numerically obtained by FT and IFT. Therefore, the numerical approach to obtain the analytic signal 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 a
                              
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         using Eq. (28) cannot be used without extra numerical treatment, because the numerically obtained Hilbert transform showing the discrepant signal near the end of time period leads to the incorrect time response for the hysteretic damping system. In the current study, a Hilbert transform superposition method is introduced to overcome this problem. This method is motivated by the fact that the analytically derived Hilbert transform does not produce the above-mentioned problem and an arbitrary impulse signal can be decomposed into a finite number of well-defined impulse signals.

                           )
                         and its imaginary-valued transformed signal 
                           
                              f
                              ^
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         which is obtained by the Hilbert transform superposition.

Another point to be considered for Hilbert transform is that the imaginary part 
                           
                              f
                              ^
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         may not be zero even at the time when the real impulse signal 
                           f
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         starts with zero value, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a) and (b). There is no doubt that such an analytic impulse signal 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 a
                              
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         leads to the incorrect damped time response of structural dynamic system, so the time duration of analytic impulse force 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 a
                              
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         which is based on the real part 
                           f
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         should be adjusted. In other words, the time duration of analytic impulse force should be extended so that the imaginary part 
                           
                              f
                              ^
                           
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         reasonably approaches zero value. Referring to 
                        Fig. 6, the time duration 
                           [

                         which is set based on the real part 
                           f
                           (
                           t
                           )
                         should be extended in both the negative and positive time directions, where the time duration extension is made by the Newton–Raphson iteration based on the fact that Hilbert transform conserves the magnitude of an original real impulse signal.

The time duration is extended equally in the negative and positive time directions, and let

There is no doubt that the analytic external force with longer extended time duration provides us more accurate time response of complex structural dynamic problem, but the total CPU time required for the time domain analysis becomes a burden. In this context, the choice of appropriate extended time duration should be made by considering these two conflicting aspects. Restricted to the convergence characteristic of the relative residual

We next apply the proposed time-duration extended Hilbert transform superposition to five-layered damped sandwich beam to analyze the time response to impulse force. Fig. 8(b) shows a fixed–fixed asymmetric five-layered damped sandwich beam subject to a double half sine impulse shown in 
                     Fig. 9(a) at the center. The material properties of aluminum and rubber layers are given in 
                     Table 2, and the sandwich beam is uniformly discretized with 17 damped beam elements presented in Section 2. The loss factor

The damped time responses of beam deflection at the point where the impulse force is applied are compared in 
                     Fig. 10(a), where IFT indicates the numerical solution obtained by taking inverse Fourier transform of the frequency response. Two solutions are in excellent agreement such that it is hard to find the difference. Fig. 10(b) compares the time responses obtained by the Hilbert transform superposition with and without the time duration extension. It is clearly observed that the Hilbert transform superposition without the time duration extension shows unstable growth after 
                        t
                        =
                        0.34
                        
                        s
                     , which is because the non-vanishing imaginary impulse force is suddenly applied at the beginning. Thus, it has been justified that the Hilbert transform superposition with time duration extension successfully provides us a stable decaying time response of complex structural dynamics which is consistent with the solution obtained by IFT.

As described in Section 4.1, the external impulse load is discretized into a finite number of rectangular impulses for the present method, but such a representation using piecewise constant functions may produce the discrete Hilbert transform far from the exact one when the shape of external impulse load is not rectangular but arbitrary. In order to investigate the influence of this subject on the present time analysis method, let us consider a double triangle impulse load shown in 
                     Fig. 11(a). Referring to the previous Fig. 4, let us discretize the impulse load in two different ways, one is the present division into a finite number of rectangular impulses and the other is the piecewise linear interpolation. In the latter case, the discrete Hilbert transform

                     . One can realize that Eq. (36) is different from Eq. (32) for the case when the external impulse load is divided into rectangular impulses. Fig. 11(b) comparatively represents the discrete Hilbert transforms of the double triangle impulse load when the time interval 
                        d
                        t
                      is set by 
                        0.01
                        
                        s
                     . It is observed that the discrete Hilbert transform obtained by the linear interpolation method is much closer to the exact one. But, the difference between two methods significantly diminishes as the time interval becomes smaller, such that the transformed signals obtained by both methods are in perfect agreement with the exact one when 
                        d
                        t
                      reaches 
                        0.0001
                        
                        s
                     , as shown in 
                     Fig. 12.

Next, the difference in the time responses of damped sandwich beam between the present rectangular impulse superposition and the piecewise linear interpolation is investigated. The fixed–fixed five-layered damped sandwich beam shown in Fig. 8(b) is also taken, where the loss factor 
                        η
                      and the thicknesses of five layers are changed to 0.1 and 
                        10.5

                      (1, 1, 6, 2 and 0.5mm from the top layer) respectively. The time duration of impulse load is extended because the transformed imaginary impulse signals start with non-vanishing negative values at 
                        t
                        =

                      required for the iterative extension of time duration are set by 0.001 and 99.9%, respectively, as in the previous case for the double half sine impulse. The transformed impulse signals shown in Fig. 12 which were obtained with 
                        d
                        t
                        =
                        0.001
                      and 
                        0.0001
                        
                        s
                      are taken for the time response analyses, because the time intervals larger than 
                        0.001
                        
                        s
                      produce the discrete Hilbert transforms far from the exact one. For the both time intervals, the total iteration numbers for the time duration extension were 14 for the present rectangular impulse superposition and 21 for the piecewise linear interpolation. Meanwhile, for both signal discretization methods, the extended time durations are as follows: 
                        −

                        t
                        ≤
                        0.187
                      for 
                        d
                        t
                        =
                        0.001
                        
                        s
                      and 
                        −
                        0.113
                        ≤
                        t
                        ≤
                        0.298
                      for 
                        d
                        t
                        =
                        0.0001
                        
                        s
                     . Thus, it has been observed that the total iteration number becomes larger for the piecewise linear interpolation and the extended time duration increases as the time interval becomes smaller.

The damped time responses of beam deflection at the point where the impulse force is applied are compared in 
                     Fig. 13, where the extended time durations were adjusted so that the time response starts from 
                        t
                        =
                        0
                        
                        s
                     . The difference in the time responses between two methods is observed at 
                        d
                        t
                        =
                        0.001
                        
                        s
                     , particularly in the amplitudes, but it almost completely disappears when the transformed signals obtained using 
                        d
                        t
                      of 
                        0.0001
                        
                        s
                      are applied. Thus, the present method using the rectangular impulse superposition can not only produce the consistent discrete Hilbert transform for non-constant arbitrary impulse forces, but it can also lead to the accurate time response of the damped sandwich beam when the time discretization interval is sufficiently small.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, a time-duration extended Hilbert transform superposition method has been introduced in order for the reliable direct time domain analysis of five-layered damped sandwich beams subject to impulse load. The conventional discrete Hilbert transform using FT and IFT which consider the input impulse forces as a periodic function leads to the incorrect Hilbert transform near the end of time period. Meanwhile, the Hilbert-transformed imaginary part of the impulse force may not be zero even at the time when the real impulse signal starts with zero value. These problems of conventional discrete Hilbert transform using FT and IFT for the direct time-domain analysis substantially lead to the unstable damped time response, and such problems have been resolved by introducing the Hilbert transform superposition and the time duration extension. The external impulse force was divided into a finite number of rectangular impulses and its Hilbert transform was obtained by superposing Hilbert transforms of each rectangular impulse. The original time duration set based on the real part of impulse force has been extended by a Newton–Raphson-based iterative residual method so that the non-vanishing imaginary impulse force at the beginning does not cause the unstable growth. From the numerical experiment for the time response analysis of five-layered damped sandwich beam, it has been justified that the present method successfully provides us a stable decaying time response which is consistent with the solution obtained by IFT. In addition, from the comparison with the piecewise linear interpolation method for discretizing the external impulse load, it has been justified that the present method can not only produce the consistent discrete Hilbert transform for non-constant arbitrary impulse forces, but it can also lead to the accurate time response, provided that the external impulse load is discretized by a sufficiently small time interval.
