                  The continuous surface cap (MAT 145) model in LS-DYNA is known by its elegant and robust theoretical basis and can well capture many important mechanical behaviors of concrete. However, it appears to be less popular than many other constitutive models in engineering application due to many material parameters involved in the model formulation which are difficult to calibrate. This study presents an effective calibration method to determine the material parameters for this model as functions of uniaxial compression strength and the maximum aggregate size of concrete according to formulas from CEB-FIP code and concrete test data from other published literatures. The obtained parameters can be conveniently used for occasional users with little or no information on concrete in hand. We further compare the predictions of stress–strain relationship in tension and compression under different confining pressures as well as hydrostatic compression by the model, and validate the model based on impact test of RC beams. Besides, the model is further compared against a similar model-MAT 159 in terms of model performance. The results demonstrate that the model based on the calibrated parameters is capable of offering reasonable and robust predictions.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Arguably one of the most widely used man-made materials, concrete underpins the performance and safety for key structures relevant to civil engineering, onshore and offshore engineering, nuclear facility protection and many others. The dynamic responses of concrete when subjected to impact or blast loads are of particular importance in many of these engineering fields, and relevant research has hence attached much interest. Computer modeling has now been widely adopted as a cheap and effective way in assisting the design of (reinforced) concrete structures under those extreme loads. Among many key ingredients that affect reliable and accurate predictions by a numerical tool, an appropriately developed and calibrated constitutive model to describe the dynamic behavior of concrete subjected to dynamic loads plays a core role.

There have been a good number of constitutive models developed in the literature for concrete, with forms ranging from relatively simple to more sophisticated (see a recent review in [1,2]). They have also been implemented in commercial software such as LS-DYNA [3], AUTODYN [4] and ABAQUS/explicit [5]. These models can be generally divided into three categories according to how the plastic deformation is calculated. Category one normally adopts an associated flow to calculate the plastic strain increment, and may capture the plastic volume expansion (dilatancy) [6] caused by shear loading at low confining pressure. It considers coupled volumetric and shear behavior (i.e. shear enhanced compaction and pressure dependence of shear strain) of concrete. Typical examples of this category include the geologic cap (MAT 25), Schwer Murray Cap, also called continuous surface cap (MAT 145), CSCM Concrete (MAT 159), Mohr Coulomb (MAT 173), and Druker Prager (MAT 193) [3]. Category two generally employs the Prandtl–Reuss flow theory (where the Von Mises criterion is used as the plastic potential) to calculate the plastic strain increment. The plastic volume strain is obtained from the equations of state (EOS), and the plastic volume strain increment is independent of the incremental flow rule (the Prandtl–Reuss flow theory). Since shear and volumetric behaviors are decoupled, the phenomenon of shear dilation cannot be captured. Typical models belong to this category are the soil and form (MAT 5/14) [3], pseudo tensor (MAT 16) [3], concrete damage (MAT 72) [3,7], Winfrith concrete (MAT 84/85) [3,8], Johnson Holmquist concrete (MAT 111) [3,9], RHT (MAT 272) [3,10] and so on. Those models have been widely used to model concrete under high impact loads. The third category commonly assumes a non-associated flow in calculating the plastic strain increment. With a different plastic potential surface than the yield surface, the shear dilatancy can be well controlled. A typical example of this category is the plastic-damage model [5,11].

When concrete is subject to low velocity impact, there are typical features needing to be captured by a model, such as shear enhanced compaction, dilatency before and after peak strength, pre-peak hardening, post-peak softening, modulus reduction/stiffness degradation under cyclic loading, irreversible deformation, and localized damage accumulation [12,13]. With a sound theoretical basis, the MAT 145 available in LS-DYNA can well capture those behaviors together [3]. However, it has not been as popular as simple ones such as the MAT 72, MAT 84/85 and the MAT 111 in engineering application, due primarily to the complexity of the model with many material parameters involved. For example, a total of 17 material parameters is required to be provided by the user in this model to define the shear and cap surface, which demands exceedingly complicated experiments ranging from uniaxial compression, uniaxial tension, triaxial compression (TXC), torsion (TOR), triaxial extension (TXE) and hydrostatic test to be conducted for their calibration, which greatly limits the practical applicability of the model. On the other hand, a “sister” model-MAT 159 [3,14,15], with internal material parameters generation based upon the unconfined compression strength 
                        
                           
                              f
                              ′
                           
                           
                              c
                           
                        
                      of concrete, aggregate size and the units has been included in LS-DYNA since version 971. This model uses the same methodology as the MAT 145 to predict the behavior of concrete before peak strength, and is different from the latter in terms of strain (post peak) softening portion for example the evolution of the both brittle damage and ductile damage norm. A comparison between the MAT 159 and MAT 145 will be provided in this research.

Indeed, similar issue exists for the MAT 72 which has a total of 49 user defined parameters. Karagozian & Case [16,17], Markovich et al. [18] managed to offer an approach of automatically generating these parameters based on the unconfined compressive strength of concrete, which considerably facilitates the easy use of the MAT 72 model.

The present study aims to develop a calibration procedure to facilitate the MAT 145 to be effective used for occasional users of LS-DYNA, in attempting to achieve the same goals as mentioned above of various studies for the MAT 72. A systematic approach will be proposed to determine the material parameters of the MAT 145 based on 
                        
                           
                              f
                              ′
                           
                           
                              c
                           
                        
                      of a concrete, and the maximum aggregate size according to the formulas provided in the CEB–FIP code [19] as well as other empirical formulas in the literature [20,21] which will be entailed in the sequel.

To facilitate the calibration of the MAT 145, a brief overview of the model is presented in this section. The MAT 145, proposed originally by Schwer and Murry [22–26], is also called the Schwer Murry Cap or continuous surface cap model in LS-DYNA material library. It is indeed a three-invariant extension of the MAT 25 [3]. This model includes a smooth failure surface and employs damage mechanics to model the strain softening and modulus degradation in both tensile and compression regimes as well as viscoplasticity for strain rate effects. It treats plastic flow and damage accumulations as separate processes based on effective stress concept and the hypothesis of strain equivalence in continuum damage mechanics (CDM). It is assumed that plastic flow, controlled by the shear stresses, may result in permanent deformation without causing degradation of elastic moduli. Meanwhile, damage is assumed to result in progressive degradation of the moduli and strength observed on the macroscale due to the propagation and coalescence of microcracks, microvoids and similar defects in the microstructural level of the material. An elliptical cap surface is added to model the plastic volume change related to pore collapse in concrete material. Besides concrete, it is capable of modeling geomaterials including soils and rock [3] and hence is indeed robust and versatile. The paper highlights its use for concrete only.

The model is featured by a combined yield surface of a shear failure surface

Strain softening and modulus reduction of concrete are modeled via an isotropic damage formulation in the model. Strain softening corresponds to a post-peak decrease in strength and modulus reduction denotes a reduction of elastic modulus in cyclic loading case. The damage criterion is based on the damage energy release rate-based approach, proposed by Simo and Ju [31], which was considered more reasonable than the equivalent strain-based and the stress-based ones [32].

A detailed description how to calibrate and determine these parameters for different grades of concrete together with a summarization of all those calibration equations will be provided in the following sections. The calibration work in this research is based on the units (mm, ton, s, N), the application can be extended to other units when the proposed material parameters are converted to other units according to the dimensional analysis results provided in 
                     Table 1, or FE models in other units are converted into ones in current unit through Precessor software i.e. ETA femb.

In view of the shear failure functions in Eq. (2a), these expressions can be regarded as a linear combination of a liner function

The last parameter S for the shape of the cap can be determined from triaxial compression test. The process is summarized as follows:

• A hydrostatic load is applied to the specimen leading the stress state to position A first (see 
                        Fig. 8), which results in a plastic volumetric strain

In the absence of triaxial compression test data, S can be also estimated from uniaxial compression test. It is known that the plastic volumetric strain expansion occurs in the shear failure surface according to an associated flow rule, while the plastic volumetric strain compaction occurs in the cap surface. Position E (initial cap intersection point) can then be regarded as the critical point separating plastic volumetric expansion from plastic volumetric compaction. Because the plastic volumetric strain expansion is found in uniaxial compression of concrete [6], so the intersection point of cap curve with the shear failure curve lies before point E is reached, and the minimum value of S can be estimated by

The linear fitting results for parameter X
                        0 is shown in 
                        Fig. 9a, and the fitting result for parameter S are shown in Fig. 9b, which appears to be rather consistent with the existing results listed in Table 1.

Damage is defined within the framework of CDM. In CDM, the damage and damage energy release rate (DERR) are commonly considered as the thermodynamic conjugates [33–35]. A damage surface is defined to determine whether damage loading occurs or not, and damage initiates and accumulates when the energy norm (a scalar measurement of strain energy), a function of DERR, exceeds the current damage threshold It is called the damage criterion here [31,32]. The evolution of the damage variables is specified in accordance with the normality rule.

The choice of free energy function is critical to the damage modeling of a material. In isothermal conditions, an equilibrium state can be described by a scalar thermodynamic potential-the Gibbs free energy density (per unit volume)

It is known to all that the strain softening response will not be objective upon mesh refinement, and will be mesh-dependent [36]. Objective can be achieved by modifying the constitutive law and making it depend on mesh size by introducing a parameter called “crack band width” [37,38] or “characteristic length”[39].

                            is an empirical parameter.

Existing experimental data shows that the peak strength attained during the direct pull and unconfined compression test is sensitive to the strain rate, which is also specified by the CEB–FIP code [19]. To account for the effect, a viscoplastic formulation with a fluidity coefficient parameter, denoted by 
                           η
                        , was employed. It is indeed a three-dimensional generalization of the Duvaut–Lions viscoplastic strain rate formulation [23].

Regarding the strain rate effect for concrete, it has been argued that the 3D FE model is capable of calculating the strength increase due to the confining stresses generated by the inertia of the structure, and there is a risk of overestimating the strength if FE calculates the failure of concrete by using both strain rate dependent strength increase factors and confining stresses due to the inertia [47–50]. In consideration of this, 
                           η
                           =
                           0
                         is suggested in this study.

To validate the applicability of the proposed material parameters for the MAT 145 to concrete in tension and compression under different confining pressures, experimental strain–stress data from existing literatures for the quasi-static case is used. Furthermore, falling weight impact test on RC beams is used to check the dynamic performance of the MAT 145 with the proposed parameters. The parameters of the MAT 145 are generated based on the calibration equations summarized in Appendix. In order to compare with a similar model-MAT 159, validations of the MAT 159 with default parameters (internal generation parameter based on uniaxial compression strength, the maximum aggregate size and units) is also carried out.

In the numerical simulation, the compression or tension are applied to the top surface of the element via ⁎Boundary Prescribed Motion keywords with a constant velocity of compression or tension, while the bottom surface is constrained on the motion direction. For triaxial compression, the confining pressure is applied to the side and ends of the element via ⁎Load Segment keywords [3].

In the following simulations, a single cubic element model with three different size (25mm, 50mm and 83mm) was used to show the element size dependent of the stress–strain curve, where C44 concrete with a maximum aggregate size of 10mm was used to generate material parameters for the MAT 145 and MAT 159. 
                        
                        Tables 3 and 4 show the input material parameters of the MAT 145 and MAT 159 for the element size of 83mm.

Evidently, the model predictions by the MAT 145 based on mesh size of 83mm (the same as the test length) match well with the pre-peak test data and show generally acceptable agreements for the post-peak response, whilst the predictions using the MAT 159 show appreciable discrepancies for both pre-peak and post-peak responses no matter what mesh size is used.

The predictions by the MAT 145 are apparently higher than those by the MAT 159. Not presented here, a further prediction of the peak tensile strength by the MAT 72 show nearly identical values with those by the MAT 145 for different grade of concrete. Besides, the predicted peak tensile strength by the MAT 159 shows very small value when

The maximum aggregate size was 76.2mm (3/8in.), and the elastic modulus E was about 41368.6MPa (6000ksi).

The predicted stress is the average value in the mid-section of the specimen shown in Fig. 15a, and the strain is calculated from the total displacement in top section of the specimen. It is evident that the predicted results by the MAT 145 compare well with test data in the case of high confining pressure, whilst the predictions by the MAT 159 shows large difference from the test data in all three cases.

The results given by the MAT 145 agree well with the theoretical value for all those concrete, whilst the results predicted by the MAT 159 are slightly smaller than the theoretical value for most concrete types though C20 concrete lies in its application range.


                        
                        Fig. 17 presents the comparisons of experimental and analytical results of hydrostatic load–unload tests. In the hydrostatic compression test, conducted by Green and Swanson [21], the size of specimen and concrete mix are the same as those introduced in Section 4.2, and the measurable permanent compaction began about 41.4MPa (6ksi) pressure. The simulated diagrams of the MAT 145 compares well with the experimental data especially in loading test, whilst the predictions by the MAT 159 differs a lot from the experimental data in both loading and unloading tests.

Fujikake [52,53] conducted tests on RC beams subject to the failing weight impact which will be used in this study to validate the performance of the Mat 145 for concrete under impact loads. In the test, a rigid hammer with a mass of 400kg was dropped freely onto the top surface of RC beams at mid-span from four different heights (0.15m, 0.30m, 0.60m, and 1.20m). The uniaxial compressive strength of concrete was 42MPa in the test, and the estimated tensile strength of concrete according to Japan Society of Civil Engineers code was 2.8MPa [52].

In the FE model, the concrete was meshed with 57852 eight-noded solid elements with size of 12.5mm. C42 concrete with the maximum aggregate size of 10mm was used to generate material parameters for the MAT 145 and MAT 159. The material input card of the MAT 145 is shown in

                        Fig. 18 shows comparisons of predicted and testing impact force and mid-span displacement for the four impact cases. For impact force history, the numerical results predicted by the MAT 145 agree rather well with the test data in terms of peak force in all impact cases, while those predicted by the MAT 159 tend to overestimate the peak force and have short impact duration. Focusing on mid-span displacement, the results predicted by both models agree well with the test curve before peak displacement, and the residual displacements from both models are slightly larger than the test value.


                        
                        Fig. 19 presents the comparisons of the predicted damage by two models and experimental results, wherein the contours of the damage range from 0 (blue) to 1 (red). In the numerical simulation, both vertical cracks and diagonal shear cracks caused by overall failure of RC beams are predicted reasonably well by both models, and the damage predicted by the MAT 145 appears to be slightly larger than that by the MAT 159.

The above comparisons indicate that the MAT 145 performs better in predicting the impact force, while the MAT 159 may be better in predicting mid-span displacement and damage distribution of the RC beam with moderate damage.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

The MAT 145 in LS-DYNA is an advanced constitutive model for geomaterials with sounded theoretical background, but contains too many parameters which limit its wide applicability. To facilitate this model for convenient use by more users, a detailed procedure of calibration of this model for concrete was presented in this study. The material parameters other than those related to the damage were obtained as functions of the uniaxial compression strength of concrete based on the CEB–FIP code and empirical formulas reported in the literature. The damage parameters are determined with consideration of a characteristic length of the finite element. The proposed formulae and relationships greatly expedite the engineering application of the model.

The proposed method was further verified by a single element and a multi-element simulation by the MAT 145 which offered reasonably good predictions for the stress–strain relationship as compared to experimental results. Compared with the MAT 159, the MAT 145 with proposed material parameters shows nearly identical peak tensile strength

                     . Furthermore, numerical simulations of RC beams subjected to the failing weight impact using the MAT 145 and MAT 159 were carried out. The results show that the MAT 145 with proposed parameters performs better than the MAT 159 for predicting the impact force, and the difference between two predicted mid-span displacements in each case is negligible.
