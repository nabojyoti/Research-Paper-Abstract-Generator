                  This study presents the development of a finite element formulation based on positions to deal with steel structures under high temperatures. The nonlinear thermal analysis is done regarding cross sections using two-dimensional flat elements while the three dimensional structural members are modeled by physical and geometrical nonlinear solid-like frame elements of any order. The thermal analysis consists in achieving, along time, the temperature profile at frame elements cross sections that affects the constitutive relations and, consequently, residual stresses at the structural mechanical equilibrium. The proposed element presents a geometrically exact description for large displacements and rotations by means of translations and generalized vectors nodal parameters. The adopted three dimensional Thermo-elastoplastic constitutive relation is based on the von Mises yielding surface for which the temperature dependence is established and an alternative flow rule is developed. Several examples are presented in order to validate the formulation and to show its good results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well known that the mechanical properties of steel degenerate significantly at elevated temperatures [1]. For example, at 700°C the strength of steel is only 23% of its ambient temperature strength. At 800°C the strength reduces to 11% and, at 900°C, to 6% of its original value. Therefore, structural designers should be able to consider the high temperature effects in the analysis of structures, especially in case of steel structures in fire situation.

The simplest way to design steel structures in fire situation is based on the verification of isolated structural members. This verification follows existent standards as described in [2–5], among others.

However, it is well known that the structural element behavior is very dependent on its interaction with other elements, mainly in fire [5,6], and that isolated analysis may lead both to super estimated or sub estimated strengths [7]. This affirmation is corroborated by the conclusions of the Cardington full-scale fire tests [8]. Full scale tests are very expensive and complex, therefore the development of computational codes or packages to accurately describe the steel (or other material) structure behavior at high temperatures (fire situations) are of great importance.

There are some computational codes that can model structures under high temperatures. These codes (or packages) can be classified as generalists and specialists, most of them are based on the Finite Element Method. Among the generalists one may mention the ANSYS, ABAQUS and DIANA. Among the specialists one may mention SAFIR [9,10], VULCAN [11,12], ADAPTIC [13–15] and FEMFAN [16–18]. Most of existing codes when using frame elements adopts one dimensional stress strain relations together with simple frame elements based on Euler–Bernoulli kinematics. In order to reduce the computational effort, some researchers have used the plastic hinge concept instead of distributed plasticity [19–23]. Lien et al. [24] proposed the vector form intrinsic finite element method to analyze the behavior of steel frames in fire.

In general they consider constant or linear temperature distribution over cross sections, i.e., few of them develop thermal analysis to determine the temperature profile over the cross section in order to make the thermo-mechanical coupling, as presented in this study.

In this work we are interested to apply a more recent kinematic description, the generalized vector frame element Coda [25] and Coda and Paccola [26,27] (a solid-like formulation) to model three dimensional steel frames under fire. The interesting features of this formulation are the use of three-dimensional generalized constitutive model considering associative or non-associative plasticity and the generalized vector parameterization that avoids the use of large rotation schemes.

The proposed three dimensional elastic–plastic model for steel under high temperatures is achieved here transforming the one dimensional diagrams to a set of multi-linear stress–strain curves at the equivalent von-Mises space. When a change of temperature occurs a new stress–strain diagram necessarily takes place and the thermodynamic consistent internal force changes in order to keep the stress level on the “moving” diagram. The change of the internal force is achieved here directly by the nullity of the plastic objective yielding potential. Due to the internal force change, for the same load level, the iterative solution process is started determining a new equilibrium position with a consequent plastic strain evolution.

The thermal analysis is done by means of a 2D finite element approach considering the nonlinear thermal behavior of materials associated with Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, including convection and radiation. The thermal formulation is nonlinear, i.e., considers the thermal properties as functions of temperature and is based on the works of Huang and Usmani [28] and Lewis et al. [29]. The 2D discretization of the thermal analysis is coincident with the discretization of the solid-like frame element cross section, making possible the direct transfer of the current temperature profile to the mechanical analysis. The engineering standard CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] is used to relate the material properties and temperature.

The proposed thermo-mechanical model allows the use of any cross section, open or not, and introduces the consistent warping into solution. The nonlinear procedure is solved by the Newton–Raphson implicit technique.

Several examples are shown in order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed formulation in solving thermo-mechanical elastoplastic problems, particularly, 3D steel frames under high temperatures.

The purpose of this section is providing the basis of the adopted formulation for the solid-like finite element. This strategy has been proposed by Coda [25] for elastic applications and consists on describing solids by means of generalized unconstrained vectors. Differently from classical formulations, the continuous mapping is done through non-unitary vectors that do not keep the orthogonality after deformation, which implies the natural consideration of shear effects on frame elements and the possibility of distorting cross sections.

Complete three-dimensional stress–strain relation is employed and, to avoid locking and improve the structure representation, warping and strain with linear variation along the transverse direction are considered. The resulting mapping represents a long solid and uses only vector variables in Euclidean space and, consequently, the values of stress, strain and position are objective measures, i.e., independent of the translations, rotations and equilibrium path.


                        
                        Fig. 1 shows a two-dimensional quadrilateral solid mapped from the dimensionless space to its shape, following both 2D classical solid procedure and the proposed vector procedure.

To illustrate the generalized vector idea we make use of a linear flat membrane and then generalize it to comprise any order frame element. The adopted linear shape functions are given by Eq. (1) and (2), with dimensionless coordinates

For simplicity, at the initial configuration the generalized vectors are adopted as unitary and orthogonal to the reference line. However, for the current configuration these vectors are unknown and are neither unitary nor orthogonal to the reference line. Finally, Eq. (6) presents the three-dimensional version of Eq. (5), whose mapping is illustrated by

                        Fig. 3 illustrates a typical mapping from initial to current configuration for a curved solid-like bar element with cubic approximation (in the longitudinal direction) and flat cross section. Although this figure shows a schematic cubic element, the developed and applied element allows the choice of any approximation order.

By adopting a complete three-dimensional constitutive law and Reissner kinematics a volume locking appears. This is due to the influence of Poisson׳s ratio and unbalanced approaches to normal and shear strains [25]. To correct this problem, the current configuration kinematics is enhanced by the introduction of linear strain behavior along transverse directions and the consideration of warping effects. From this reasoning Eq. (10) is rewritten as:

                         is the new degree of freedom (unknown) approximated along the finite element as the other variables. Eq. (11) represents an objective vector mapping from the dimensionless space to the current configuration of the body. This mapping results in 12 degrees of freedom per node that are: three translations, six vector components, two intensity values of the strain rate in the transverse directions and the warping intensity.

In order to give a brief, but complete, description of the developed thermo-mechanical solution, this section shows the basic steps of the elastic geometrical nonlinear solution procedure. First of all it is necessary to detach that the elastic constitutive relation is dependent of temperature; however this dependence is quite simple as the temperature profile is introduced as an independent variable (related to time) to be achieved by the thermal part of the method. Moreover, we consider negligible the heat generation resulting from the mechanical dissipation for quasi-static fire analysis. For applications that this heat generation is important (as high speed impact) the reader is invited to consult the work of Carrazedo and Coda [33] and others cited therein.

In this section, the elastic Saint-Venant–Kirchhoff constitutive relation is adopted to relate the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress and the Green strain for frame elements, including thermal dilatation strains. Moreover the nonlinear equilibrium equation is achieved by the principle of stationary energy. Plasticity is introduced in Section 4 and the thermo-mechanical procedure in Sections 6 and 7.

As mentioned before the specific strain energy to be adopted here is the Saint-Venant–Kirchhoff one, that relates the Green strain and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress in a linear way,

The Newton–Raphson procedure is used here to solve the nonlinear equilibrium, which is described in Section 5, including the physical nonlinear behavior of materials.

The difference between the elastic and inelastic procedures is the way the potential energy of external forces is transferred to the deformed body and dissipated during the loading process. In this case, instead of using the elastic strain energy, one uses the Helmholtz free energy potential, that usually does not have an explicit expression; however, its variation is known [35].

Following this reasoning the total potential energy is written as:

Therefore, the dependence of temperature is omitted in the passages where it does not have importance and opportunely resumed.

Even for inelastic problems, the energy conjugate of the free energy potential regarding Green strain is the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. In this way, Eq. (29) can be written exactly as Eq. (25). However, with a physical nonlinear meaning, i.e., while the passage from Eqs. (24) and (25) is done by a simple differentiation of the quadratic potential shown by Eq. (17), now it is necessary the definition of inelastic (plastic for instance) constitutive relations to describe the material behavior and its evolution rule. Moreover, this elastoplastic relation should be adapted to comprise imposed temperature changes.

In this section, the constitutive elastoplastic relation is described. One may classify the developed constitutive relation as non-associative with an unknown plastic potential for which its normal direction (plastic flow) is defined by the trial stress direction. The theoretical basis of this constitutive relation is given by the study of volume change in plastic phase given by Botta et al. [36]. Moreover, we assume a multi-linear stress strain diagram (in the von-Mises equivalent space) without a limit for the number of elastoplastic patches, which enables an accurate reproduction of any stress strain relation.

Although, the developed displacements are high, the strain level present in our applications is relatively small. Therefore, the Green strain approximates the linear strain and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress can be used in place of the Cauchy stress. Following this reasoning we adopt the additive strain decomposition, as:

Although the equivalent strain is not used at this stage of the solution, see Section 7, it is worth mentioning that it is calculated following a similar way as the equivalent stress, i.e.,

Instead of introducing a plastic potential which gradient imposes the plastic flow direction, see Eq. (34), we prefer to define the plastic flow from the current stress state (trial in practical situations) as indicated by [36], that is:

Instead of following classical procedure, for which the previous equations are solved in an infinitesimal way, from basic definitions and considering the hardening parameter H constant by parts (multi-linear plasticity) we write an implicit (numerical) closed solution for the constitutive model variables. We assume a typical interval

As mentioned in introduction the main objective of this study is the mechanical behavior of steel structures under high temperatures (fire). Therefore, this section briefly describes the transient thermal analysis used to generate the temperature profiles at the cross sections of structural members. Most of equations, developments and implementations are based on Huang and Usmani [28] and Lewis et al. [29]. In the next section, knowing the temperature profile, the elastoplastic constitutive relation is adapted to comprise temperature changes.

In this study, thermal analyses are based on the classical heat diffusion (or conduction) equation in solids,

Considering the discretization of a domain (in this case a cross section at the reference configuration) by finite elements (Fig. 4(a)) and applying the method of weighted residuals with consideration of the appropriate boundary conditions, one achieves Eq. (67) which describes, in matrix form, the balance of heat flow inside the considered domain at a given instant.

In Eq. (67) [C] is the heat capacity matrix, [K] is the thermal stiffness matrix and {F} is the vector of nodal heat flux. The matrices [C], [K] and vector {F} are known while {θ} is the vector of unknown parameters (temperature). The nonlinear characteristic of Eq. (67) is the dependence on temperature of matrices [C] and [K] which becomes evident in the solution process.

To obtain the numerical solution of Eq. (67) it is necessary to discretize the differential operator involving the transient term 
                        ∂
                        θ

                     . Here it is done using a numerical approximation based on the Finite Difference Method, with a strategy similar to that presented in [28,29].

In order to solve Eq. (73) one needs to choose the value of ϕ, which defines the integration scheme. According Cook et al. [38], for values of 
                        ϕ
                        ≥
                        0.5
                      the solution of linear or nonlinear problems are unconditionally stable and when it is assumed to be 2/3 the Galerkin scheme is followed.

At elevated temperatures one must consider the thermal properties of materials as a function of temperature, such as specific heat, density and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the thermal flow at boundary of structural members is highly dependent of the typical actions of fire. This aspect gives to the thermal problem a nonlinear characteristic, detached in the temperature dependence of

                     Section 4 describes the elastoplastic constitutive relation, Section 5 indicates how the nonlinear mechanical problem is solved and Section 6 briefly describes how the temperature profile is achieved in a bar element cross section. In this item, considering known the temperature profile, the constitutive relation is extended to include the temperature influence.

As mentioned before, when temperature changes the mechanical properties of material change, as elastic modulus, hardening parameter and strength levels. Taking as reference the Eurocode CEN EN1993-1-2:2005 [30], the steel reduction factors for yielding strength f

                           p
                         and elastic modulus E as a function of temperature can be described by 
                        Fig. 6.

Following [30] a general diagram of uniaxial stress–strain relation for carbon steel can be seen in 
                        Fig. 7.

Particularly, as an example, for steel with yielding limit of 250MPa and strain up to 2% some stress–strain relations achieved using [30] can be seen in 
                        Fig. 8.

As mentioned before, we assume a multi-linear stress strain diagram without a limit for the number of elastoplastic patches, which enables an accurate reproduction of any stress strain relation. The most important point of the diagram that should be precisely indicated is 
                           (
                           ε
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 p
                              
                           
                           )
                         that defines the beginning of plastic evolution, as it should be in accordance with the elastic modulus definition.

First of all, the uniaxial diagrams of Figs. 7 and 8 are transformed to equivalent stress–strain relations (based on Eqs. (39) and (40)) simply dividing it by 
                           
                              3
                           
                        . Therefore, at an imposed load level and temperature the structure is at equilibrium and one knows, from Eqs. (39), (40), (51) and (52), the equivalent stress (
                           
                              σ
                              ¯
                           
                           (
                           θ
                           )
                        ), the equivalent strain (
                           
                              ε
                              ¯
                           
                           (
                           θ
                           )
                        ), the developed equivalent plastic strain (
                           λ
                           (
                           θ
                           )
                        ) and the thermodynamic internal force (
                           χ
                           (
                           θ
                           )
                        ). The last two values store the history of plastic evolution along the loading process, including previous temperature changes. The equivalent strain already contains the thermal dilatation related to temperature changes.

If, for this load level, a temperature change occurs our task is to find the new values 
                           
                              σ

                        , 
                           
                              ε
                              ¯
                           
                           (
                           θ

                           )
                        , 
                           λ
                           (
                           θ
                           +

                           θ
                           )
                         and 
                           χ
                           (
                           θ

                           )
                        . As it is a nonlinear process, one should remember that before and after the change of temperature these values should respect the restriction:

                        and solved, as did previously, finding Δλ and all new variables to be updated in the Newton–Raphson iterative process of the mechanical equilibrium. It is worth noting that the hardening parameter in Eq. (86) is also known directly from the new equivalent stress–strain diagram. Moreover, after solving (86) a plastic strain develops resulting in a mechanical accommodation due to the reduction of the thermodynamic internal force promoted by the change in stress–strain diagram. It is important to note that for cooling the procedure is the same, however in most situations, the internal force grows and the step is elastic. Fig. 9 shows a representation of the steps described in this item.

In this section some high temperature examples are used to show the possibilities of the formulation, as well as to demonstrate its good results when compared with other computational codes and references. For validation examples at room temperature comprising inelastic analyses of steel frames the reader is invited to consult [39]. For applications that heat generation is important (as high speed impact) the reader is invited to consult [33].

Our code will be called SYSAF all along this section. Only the last two examples employ the nonlinear thermal solver, as there is a lack of references to perform comparisons.

A simply supported beam, 
                        Fig. 10, is analyzed under actions of heating and cooling using the CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] temperature dependence of the constitutive model and relative thermal elongation for steel at high temperatures. The achieved results are compared with the ones presented by Yu et al. [12] using solid elements, via ABAQUS and VULCAN softwares.

Yu et al. [12] solved this problem using both solid and frame elements. They adopted 1920 hexahedral solid finite elements (16 for a cross section) and three quadratic beam finite elements.

In our work we adopt a temperature step of 2.5°C, four cubic finite elements and eighth triangular cubic “elements” for thermal considerations and elastoplastic treatment of cross sections. Moreover, we solved the same example using the ANSYS package using ten quadratic BEAM189 elements.

Results of midspan displacements versus temperature are compared in 
                        Fig. 11. As one can see, results achieved by [12] are in reasonable accordance to ABAQUS, however our results compare very well with ANSYS.

Next examples compare SYSAF with experimental results and other computational codes confirming the good behavior of our formulation to model steel frame structures under fire.


                        
                        Fig. 12 shows a typical beam tested by Rubert and Schaumann [40] with the objective of verifying the behavior of structures subjected simultaneously to mechanical and thermal actions.

Izzuddin et al. [14] present numerical results using their computational code (ADAPTIC) to model a Rubert and Schaumann [40] beam. We did the same using our code (SYSAF). The cross section of the beam is of type IPE 80 and is discretized as depicted in Fig. 12(b). The beam is discretized by four cubic finite elements.

Four load levels, proportional to the collapse load at 20°C, are imposed to the beam. The proportionality constants are 0.2, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.85. At 20°C the elastic modulus is

                        Table 1 following [40,14]. The stress–strain diagrams are built following CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30].

The test displacement at the midspan of the beam by [40], regarding temperature and each load level, are depicted in 
                        Fig. 13 together with the results achieved by SYSAF and ADAPTIC [14].

As one may note the results achieved by the developed code compare well with the ones achieved by ADAPTIC and reproduce the experimental behavior of the beam.

Three series of scaled steel frames, called EHR, EGR and ZSR (
                        Fig. 14), tested by and Rubert and Schaumann [40] are considered. All cross sections are of the type IPE 80. Frame series EHR and EGR are uniformly heated while only the left cell of frame ZSR is heated.

These cases were numerically analyzed by [14,16,23,24,40] among others. In order to make comparisons our code (SYSAF) is compared with experimental values given by Rubert and Schaumann [40] and the numerical results presented by Izzuddin et al. [14] using their package ADAPTIC.

In

                           y,0 means the yielding limit at 20°C.

At 20°C the elastic modulus is

                        ) reduction factors are given by Table 1 and the stress–strain diagrams are built following CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30].

We employed SYSAF with four cubic frame elements and the cross section discretization presented in Fig. 12(b). The experimental and numerical collapse temperatures are presented in 
                        Table 3.

Both SYSAF and ADAPTIC achieved collapse temperatures lower than the experimental ones. Moreover relative differences are less than 6%. The experimental displacements [40], regarding temperature and load level, are depicted in 
                        
                        
                        Figs. 15–17 together with the results achieved by SYSAF and ADAPTIC [14].

As it can be seen our formulation gives good results for these cases when compared to experimental and numerical results achieved by [14] using DAPTIC.

The three-dimensional frame, 
                        Fig. 18, was firstly analyzed by Souza Júnior and Creus [23] using the package SAFIR. All sections are of the type H 150×150×7×10 and the material is steel with 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 y
                              
                           
                           =
                           325
                           
                           MPa
                        . The load 
                           F
                           =
                           250
                           
                           kN
                         is applied before heating. The constitutive relation and relative thermal elongation follow CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] recommendations.

The fire is simulated by a uniform heating of all first floor frame elements. Each member is discretized by four cubic frame elements. The cross section discretization follows the same pattern described in Fig. 12(b).

Displacements at points H1 and H2 (Fig. 18) achieved by our formulation (SYSAF), ANSYS (BEAM189) and SAFIR [23] are compared in 
                        Fig. 19.

As it can be seen all codes give similar results (less than 2.5% of difference for collapse temperature), confirming that our formulation is adequate to solve steel structures under high temperatures and uniform heating conditions. Moreover, our formulation applies three-dimensional constitutive relation, which indicates a more general approach for frame elements. Next examples show cases for which the cross section thermal analyses are required.

This example was presented by Landesmann et al. [22] and is the simulation of a pin-ended IPE-360 beam-column exposed to a standard time–temperature curve ISO 834 [41].

The two analyzed models are depicted in 
                        Fig. 20, including the geometry and both mechanical and thermal loads. The load combination (N and M) is fraction of the strength capacity of the column at 20°C, i.e., N
                        y20 (compression) and M
                        p20 (bending).

In the first situation the beam-column is heated at all faces (Fig. 20(a)) while in the second situation only three faces of the column are heated (Fig. 20(b)). Following [22] the last situation represents a facade column where one of the flanges is partially protected from fire.

The adopted cross section discretization and the achieved temperature profile at 200s, 500s and 800s of analysis using SYSAF are described, respectively, in 
                        
                        
                        Figs. 21–23.

At 20°C the material presents 
                           E
                           =
                           205
                           
                           GPa
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 f
                              
                              
                                 y
                              
                           
                           =
                           250
                           
                           MPa
                        . The stress–strain diagram and relative thermal elongation elongation follow CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] recomendations.

The achieved results by Landesmann et al. [22] using SAFIR and SAAFE are compared with our results at 
                        Fig. 24. It is important to note that SAAFE adopts concentrated plasticity, while SAFIR and SYSAF adopt distributed plasticity. One can see in Fig. 24 that our results are in good conformity with the ones presented by [22] using SAFIR, i.e., distributed plasticity.

The Vogel׳s portal frame [42] is solved here for a fire situation proposed by Landesmann et al. [22]. The original loading combination was applied at different load ratios ψ. The structure is exposed to heating according the ISO 834 curve [41]. All the members were assumed to be fire protected at the external faces (
                        Fig. 25).

We adopted four cubic finite elements for each structural member. The thermal analysis is carried out using the discretizations depicted in 
                        Fig. 26(a) and (b) for cross sections HEB 300 and HEA 340. Fig. 26 also shows the temperature fields at 750s.

The relative thermal elongation and stress–strain relation follow CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30]. 
                        Fig. 27 compares our results (SYSAF) with the ones presented by Landesmann et al. [22] (SAFIR) for load ratios ψ equal to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8.

As one can see the results are in good agreement between formulations which implies that both formulations may be used to model structures under high temperatures. Our results present a more stiff behavior when compared to the one presented by Landesmann et al. [22] for low load factors. However, it is not possible to conclude that this difference is associated with difference in formulations, as the problem is very dependent on the large amount of variables and boundary conditions prescribed. However, we believe that using a 3D formulation, as ours, more realistic results can be achieved in more general analysis.

In order to explore the possibilities of the developed formulation we solve a typical case that demand thermal analysis for determining the temperature field of the steel profile during heating, i.e., temperature field cannot be determined by means of simplified equations. Moreover, a convergence analysis is performed regarding mechanical and thermal behavior of the solution indicating the fast convergence of the integration procedure.

A steel beam with cross section H 200×100×5.5×8 embedded in a concrete slab (
                        Fig. 28) submitted to fire is analyzed. Only the bottom surfaces of the beam and slab are exposed to effects of ambient heating according the ISO 834 standard fire curve [41]. Heat exchange to an ambient at 20°C is also considered at the top of slab. The resultant emissivity for steel and concrete is assumed 0,7. The heat transfer convection coefficient is assumed

At 20°C a simplified stress–strain diagram is adopted with elastic modulus 
                           E
                           =
                           210
                           
                           GPa

                           =

                         and Poisson ratio

                           =
                           0.0
                        . Perfect elastoplasticity is adopted until a strain of 0.15, when a softening is imposed reducing stress to zero at a strain of 0.2.

Only two cubic elements are able to capture the exact elastic bending moment distribution of the proposed static scheme. However, for the elastoplastic analysis the integration points, responsible to capture residual stresses, should be near to the center of the beam. Therefore, we used four finite elements, two with 195cm length near the ends and two with 5cm near the center to model the structure. No sensible changes in results are achieved when varying the central elements lengths.

The very good convergence of the plastic behavior can be seen in 
                           Fig. 29 for which two cross section discretizations are tested, one very poor with 18 triangular divisions, see 
                           Fig. 30a, and other with 62 triangular divisions, see Fig. 30b. As one can see, the very poor discretization presents practically the same results as the regular one, characterizing convergence. Moreover, the maximum difference in force among each other is less than 0.27%. Thirty seven displacement steps of 1mm each are imposed at the center of the beam.

The achieved collapse load is

                           ) calculated using the uniaxial yielding stress, revealing the influence of the shear stress in the collapse.

The same pattern of steel cross section discretizations, used for the mechanical convergence analysis, are used to solve the thermal problem, now including the presence of concrete acting as a heat sink material, as shown in 
                           Fig. 31.


                           
                           Fig. 32 shows the ISO 834 standard fire curve, which determines the ambient temperature evolution, and temperature of points A and B (see fig. 28) along time for both discretizations. The maximum time for thermal analysis (240min) was adopted considering the double of the maximum required fire resistance time found in design codes. As one can see no sensible difference among the presented results for both discretizations is achieved, revealing the very good convergence of the thermal problem when using the adopted cubic finite element.

Based on the achieved results, it is evident that the difference between the top and bottom temperatures has a large dependence regarding time. Which means that, for this case, the use of a simplified temperature profile during the heating is not an option, especially when considering the initial time, until 120min, the maximum found in design codes.

As simplified temperatures profile does not apply for this case, we present a complete thermo-mechanical analysis to serve as a reference for further works and also to perform a final convergence analysis. In order to do so, the CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] temperature dependence of the constitutive model and relative thermal elongation for steel at high temperatures are considered. From these considerations, the temperature profile for the steel cross section achieved by the previous thermal analysis is used to model the simple supported beam indicated in Fig. 28 subjected to a transverse load of

                           Fig. 33 shows the vertical displacement versus time and indicates that the collapse occurs in 25min. Moreover, the convergence is also characterized as the use of the very poor discretization presents practically the same result as the one achieved by the final discretization of the thermal and mechanical convergence analyses.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this study we successfully apply a new geometrical nonlinear formulation, based on positions, to model three-dimensional frame structures under high temperatures (fire). The formulation is geometrically exact and does not use finite rotation, but generalized vectors, to represent large displacements and rotations for frame analysis. A two-dimensional nonlinear thermal module of analysis is developed and implemented to solve the cross section temperature profile.

The three-dimensional thermo-mechanical coupling is developed adjusting, at the equivalent stress space, the stress–strain diagrams following standardized reduction factors. Moreover the adjustment of internal force, respecting the yielding surface at any temperature, is proposed and successfully tested. Numerical implementations have been carried out resulting in the SYSAF package. Various examples are solved, comparing results with experimental and other numerical methods, confirming that the proposed formulation is able to solve steel structures in fire.
