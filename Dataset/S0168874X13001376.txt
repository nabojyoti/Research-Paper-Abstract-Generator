                  This paper is concerned with the development and application of high order full integrated tetrahedral finite elements to large deformable elastoplastic homogeneous solids. This strategy differs from usual ones adopted in literature that use low order and sub-integration methods to solve this kind of problems. The motivation is to find a more precise stress distribution inside solids that develops large strains in elastoplastic situations.
                  In order to do so, two elastoplastic formulations are developed and implemented. The first, called hyperelastoplastic, is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, the intermediate configuration, and the elastic Mandel stress tensor, and it is devoted to large strain evolution. The second, called Green–Naghdi elastoplastic, is based on the additive decomposition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor and the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, and it is devoted to small strain and is used as a reference to the second development.
                  In both cases, the three-dimensional von Mises yield criterion, the associative plastic flow rule and mixed hardening are used. Some structural problems have been numerically simulated, and convergence analysis is carried out. The results for the force versus displacement and the distributions of the plastic parameters are provided. The numerical results show that, as expected, the analysis error can be controlled by mesh refinement. The presented hyperelastoplastic formulation can model both finite elastic and finite plastic strains.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The main issue addressed here is the prediction of the mechanical behavior of elastoplastic homogeneous materials under finite strains and finite deformations, isothermal conditions and statically applied forces. The mechanical behavior prediction is an indispensable step for proper design of mechanical or structural components. There are many ways to perform this kind of prediction. However, it is well known that the computational – or numerical – methods are more general and more practicable when compared to the analytical and experimental methods. The most widespread numerical method applied to structural analysis is the Finite Element Method (FEM).

Regarding numerical analysis of elastoplastic materials, two important applications are the sheet metal forming (see, for instance, [1–3]) and the modeling of bridge elastomeric bearings [4]. As pointed out by [5], the FEM analysis of sheet metal forming components has become an essential industrial tool. Two examples of materials often analyzed in elastoplastic regime can be mentioned: the metals, which usually present elastoplastic behavior with small elastic strains [6]; and the rubber-like materials, which can present softening behavior together with large elastic strains [7,8].

With respect to the elastoplastic material model, some concepts from small strain analysis can be extended to the finite strain situation, such as: deformation measure decomposition, yield criterion, isotropic and kinematic hardening, consistency condition, return algorithm, and consistent tangent operator (for a good overview on these concepts, see [9–14]). In order to simplify the formulation when the material exhibits small strains, one may employ the additive decomposition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor into the elastic and the plastic parts [11,15]. However, this decomposition is not valid for large strain applications (for further details, see [16]). A more suitable and well accepted kinematic approach in finite strains is the Kröner–Lee decomposition [17–19], in which the deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and the plastic parts. Regarding the constitutive modeling, one way to set the elastoplastic material response is to employ a thermodynamic formulation, i.e., a formulation based on the dissipation inequality. This kind of formulation when applied to finite strains is often called hyperelastoplastic model ([13,19–23]).

It is well known that for 3D FEM applications (elastic or elastoplastic, developing or not large strains) low order elements with reduced integration techniques [24] and hourglass modes stabilization methods [25] are usually employed. This choice occurs due to the processing limitations when large meshes are required. In the context of low order tetrahedral elements, several improvements have been made in order to avoid locking problems (see, for instance, [26–29]). However, it is also well known that although the overall displacement results achieved employing these techniques are acceptable, the stress–strain fields are not well represented by the low order elements. When further studies depend upon residual stresses and strains, as for example the instability analysis of thin walled structures [30], the importance of the resulting stress–strain fields grows.

To improve the stress–strain field prediction in FEM analysis of 3D large deformable elastoplastic homogeneous solids we propose to use a family of fully integrated high order tetrahedral finite elements [31] together with a position based finite element description for geometrical non-linear problems [32–34] associated with a parallel processing strategy [35].

Therefore, the present study proposes a numerical strategy to simulate, via high order tetrahedral solid finite elements, elastoplastic homogeneous materials under statically applied forces, isothermal conditions, finite displacements and finite strains. In the context of this paper, as far as the authors know, there are no published studies regarding high order tetrahedral finite elements. Some examples of the present study compare low order and high order tetrahedral solid finite elements and show the convergence of results when meshes are refined.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 the finite element kinematic approximation is briefly described, showing that the element order is freely chosen; moreover, positions are set as unknown parameters. Section 3 shows the hyperelastoplastic constitutive model formulation followed by the Green–Naghdi approximation. In Section 4 the equilibrium equation and the non-linear solving strategy is addressed. Section 5 shows the so called return algorithm that enables to numerically apply the developed elastoplastic models. Some computational aspects are highlighted in Section 6. Section 7 presents various examples to validate the proposed strategy and conclusions are presented in Section 8.

In order to numerically describe the configuration of the body or structure the FEM is employed here. In this study the adopted finite element family is the isoparametric solid tetrahedron of any order. Regarding the kinematic approximation, the positions are used as unknown variables instead of displacements [32,36]. In this FEM version both initial and current configurations of each tetrahedral element are mapped as follows:

In order to use the above mentioned generalized order element, the numerical strategy developed in [31] is employed. With this technique, one can automatically calculate the shape functions (ϕ
                     
                        k
                     ) and their derivatives 
                        ∂
                        
                           
                              ϕ
                           
                           
                              k
                           
                        
                        /
                        ∂
                        ξ
                      at any point within the element domain for any polynomial order. Such values are used in Eqs. (1), (2), (6) and (7). Section 6 shows more information regarding the calculation of these values.

The mechanical behavior of materials is mathematically described by means of constitutive models – or laws. In this paper two main constitutive models are presented. The first is a general hyperelastoplastic model based mainly on the works of [21,22] and [23]. The second is a simplification for small strains, based on the works of [11,15] and [16]. Other consulted works are mentioned along the developing subsections as [13], [19] and [20], for instance. Various developing steps are described in order to make the paper self-contained.

As the present analysis involves finite elastoplastic deformations, the deformation gradient (Eq. (5)) is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and plastic parts [13,23,37]. This decomposition is called Kröner–Lee decomposition [17–19] and can be mathematically described as follows:
                           
                              (11)
                              
                                 F
                                 =
                                 
                                    
                                       F
                                    
                                    
                                       e
                                    
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       F
                                    
                                    
                                       p
                                    
                                 
                              
                           
                        where subscripts ( )
                           e
                         and ( )
                           p
                         correspond to the elastic and plastic parts, respectively. This decomposition leads to the notion of an intermediate configuration, defined as F=F
                        
                           p
                        . According to [6], this intermediate configuration is relaxed (or stress-free) and locally defined.

Using Eq. (11) one can decompose the Jacobian (Eq. (8)), the right Cauchy–Green stretch tensor (Eq. (9)) and the Green–Lagrange strain tensor (Eq. (10)), which are objective strain measures, as follows:

Similarly to hyperelastic materials [38–40], the hyperelastoplastic ones [13,19–22] are those in which the material response – or the mechanical behavior – is described by the scalar potential called Helmholtz free-energy function (ψ). In this paper, following [22], the Helmholtz free-energy function is additively decomposed into the elastic (ψ

                         are, respectively, the Saint Venant–Kirchhoff [39] and the neo-Hookean hyperelastic model [41]; λ and μ are the Lamé constants; Λ is the bulk modulus; and tr( ) is the trace operator. As one can see, in both models ((21) and (22)), when the elastic strains vanish, the elastic Helmholtz function vanishes, i.e.: ψ

The stress measure used in the present numerical formulation is the (symmetric) second Piola–Kirchhoff stress tensor, represented here by S and defined at the initial configuration. In order to establish the relation among the stress and strain measures (see Section 3.1) one uses the second law of thermodynamics and the Coleman–Noll procedure. Following [22] one finds:

                         is the fourth-order hyperelastoplastic consistent tangent operator. Explicit equations to calculate this fourth-order tensor are given in the Appendix A. According to [14], by using the elastoplastic consistent tangent operator, the convergence is improved and, thus, the processing time is reduced.

In some applications, the strain evolution results in small values, therefore the additive decomposition of the Green–Lagrange strain tensor (see Eqs. (10), (17)–(19)), into the elastic and plastic parts can be employed [11,15]:

In the present study the equilibrium of each finite element (Section 2) and, hence, of the whole structure is described at the current configuration (
                        y
                     ) by means of the Principle of Stationary Potential Energy. In static and isothermal structural problems, this equilibrium principle can be described, in Lagrangian formulation, as follows [40,43]:

                        H
                      is the Hessian (or tangent stiffness) matrix. As one can note in expression (56), the external forces (

                     ) are considered conservative, i.e., the applied forces do not depend of the current configuration (
                        y
                     ). Besides, to obtain the equilibrium path (or the successive equilibrated positions) the external forces are incrementally applied, that is, they are divided into load steps. It is obvious from Eq. (56) that to find the equilibrium position it is necessary to simultaneously solve the non-linear stress–strain relation (constitutive model) theoretically discussed in Section 3. Next section discusses the numerical treatment of the constitutive models.

As mentioned before, in elastoplastic regime, inside the Newton–Raphson procedure adopted to find the equilibrium position, one must solve the current state of mechanical variables following the adopted constitutive model. For the hyperelastoplastic model, this current state is defined here by the set (

                        ,

                        X
                     ). In order to do so an elastic predictor/plastic corrector algorithm [14] is used. In the prediction stage, the plastic variables are assumed to be constant along a generic load step (see Section 4), resulting:

                              p
                           
                        
                      and 
                        X
                      have nine components. To apply the Newton–Raphson technique, it is necessary to calculate the derivatives of all the components of 
                        
                           
                              r
                           
                           
                              r
                              e
                              t
                           
                        
                      with respect to 
                        
                           
                              F
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                     , κ, 
                        X
                      and 
                        Δ
                        λ
                     . These variables are updated until the vector 
                        
                           
                              r
                           
                           
                              r
                              e
                              t
                           
                        
                      is sufficiently small.

After the solving the system the plastic variables (
                        
                           
                              F
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                        ,
                        κ
                        ,
                        X
                     ) are updated and the equilibrium Eq. (54) must be verified. If the residual force vector (55) is not sufficiently small, the Newton–Raphson iterative technique is used again in order to obtain a new current position (
                        y
                     ) and, thus, a new deformation gradient (
                        F
                     ). With this new current configuration (
                        y
                     ), if the yield criteria (29) is not satisfied, the elastic predictor/plastic corrector algorithm is employed again to guarantee that 
                        ϕ
                        =
                        0
                     . As one can see, the iterative procedure continues until the state of variables (
                        F
                        ,
                        
                           
                              F
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                        ,
                        κ
                        ,
                        X
                     ) guarantees, simultaneously, equilibrium (
                        r
                        =
                        0
                     ) and yield criterion condition (
                        ϕ
                        =
                        0
                     ).

For the Green–Naghdi formulation (Section 3.6), the state of mechanical variables, which must satisfy both equilibrium (54) and yield criterion (29), is represented by the set (
                        E
                        ,
                        
                           
                              E
                           
                           
                              p
                           
                        
                        ,
                        κ
                        ,
                        X
                     ). Thus, during the elastic prediction phase, expressions (58) and (59) are replaced by

In this section, some computational aspects are described, such as the general expressions to calculate the shape functions and their derivatives, the computer algorithm flowchart and the solver used.

As mentioned in the introduction, the objective of this paper is to achieve reliable stress fields inside a 3D solid developing hyperelastoplasticity. Therefore, some computational aspects of this study can be highlighted. First of all, it is necessary to calculate the derivatives of the tetrahedral element shape functions regarding dimensionless variables to be applied in the basic kinematic developments of Section 2. This calculation must be automatic, that is, not dependent on the order of the element.

Shape functions are written as

The flowchart of the computer algorithm is provided in 
                        Fig. 1. Gaussian quadrature is used to calculate integrals of expressions (54) and (56). The numerical integration points and weights are given by [44–46]. The elastic predictor/plastic corrector algorithm, described in Section 5, is performed at each Gauss point. In the present study, no reduced integration schemes [24] and no hourglass modes stabilization [25] are employed, i.e., the elements are fully integrated. Regarding the solution of the system

                        The computer code developed is written in FORTRAN language. Distributed memory parallel processing techniques [35] are employed in order to reduce the processing time and improve the memory capacity.

                        ) is parallelized, i.e., each processor performs these calculations for its elements. However, only one processor (the master) assembles and solves the global system

To validate the present formulation some problems have been analyzed using the developed computer code. The main results of the simulations are given in this section. In all the examples, the adopted tolerance for the error, see Eqs. (75)–(77), and for the yield criterion (34) is

The first example is a prismatic bar under uniaxial deformation (see 
                        Fig. 2). This problem is studied in [23], and the material is a metal (mild steel CK15). Only kinematic hardening is present, as the isotropic hardening law is a constant function, see Fig. 2 and Eq. (38). The problem is performed incrementally via displacement control applied at the face

                        . As the strain field is homogeneous all over the bar it is not necessary to make a mesh refinement convergence analysis, and linear approximation can be used. The bar is then discretized by six linear tetrahedral solid finite elements.

The evolution of the longitudinal backstress, defined at the intermediate configuration and associated with kinematic hardening (see Eq. (26)), is showed in 
                        Fig. 3. The agreement between the results of this paper and the ones of the reference [23] can be clearly seen in

The second numerical problem, also extracted from [23], is a cube under simple shear conditions (see 
                        Fig. 5). The material in this case is a glassy polymer. As in the first example, six solid tetrahedral elements of linear order are used and no mesh convergence analysis is necessary. Displacement control is incrementally applied at the face x
                        2=1.0 along direction x
                        1, and all the other degrees of freedom are restricted. Thus, all the current positions are known at a given deformation level, and the unknown variables are the plastic parameters.

One can see, in 
                        Fig. 6, the effects of the kinematic hardening on the backstress defined at the intermediate configuration (see Eq. (26)). As in the first numerical example, the accordance of the present formulation results with the reference [23] is showed in 
                        Fig. 7a, in which the following equations are used:

                         is the displacement of face x
                        2=1.0 (see Fig. 5); and L
                        2=1.0 is the initial length of the cube along direction x
                        2. The above expressions are defined regarding the coordinate system illustrated in Fig. 5. Along all the numerical simulation, the value of the cross-section area S
                        0 remains the same. Again, the results of the hyperelastoplastic model (Sections 3.1–3.5) and the Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model (Section 3.6) are very different for moderate and large strains (see Fig. 7b), and the Cauchy stress evolution with the linearized shear strain results are in perfect agreement with the ones presented by [23].

The third example is a tridimensional elastomeric block under partial compression (see 
                        Fig. 8). The material properties are the same as the second example (see Fig. 5). Due to the double symmetry, in respect to the planes x
                        2=10.0 and x
                        3=10.0, only one quarter of the block has been discretized (see Fig. 8). The Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model (see Section 3.6) is not used to solve this problem.

Regarding the vertical displacement of point A, the problem solution converges to the reference solution presented by [23] (see 
                        Table 1 and 
                        Fig. 9). One can observe that, although mesh refinement improves the accuracy, it increases the processing time significantly (see Table 1). For the most refined mesh, the displacement field at the end of some specific steps is depicted in 
                        Fig. 10. A convergence analysis regarding the backstress tensor 
                           X
                         at the end of step 50 is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 11, in which one can note that, although the most refined mesh of linear order provides quite good results regarding displacements, it presents severe locking regarding the backstress component

As pointed out in Section 3.5, the hyperelastoplastic consistent tangent operator (
                           
                              
                                 ℘

                        ) has been developed, see Eq. (43). Thus, in order to show the improvement in the solution convergence, one of the meshes employed here has been analyzed again comparing two strategies: the purely elastic prediction, i.e., without using the consistent operator 
                           
                              
                                 ℘
                              
                              
                                 h
                                 e
                                 p
                              
                           
                        ; and the elastoplastic prediction, using the consistent operator 
                           
                              
                                 ℘
                              
                              
                                 h
                                 e
                                 p
                              
                           
                        . The mesh used for this comparison has 75 nodes (225 degrees of freedom) and 24 elements of quadratic order. The analysis has been carried out until the end of phase 1 (step 50). As one can see in 
                        Fig. 12, the use of the hyperelastoplastic consistent operator reduces considerably the number of iterations and the processing time, and the results regarding displacements are practically the same for the two strategies.

To show the influence of the number of processors on the simulation time and, thus, to justify the use of refined discretizations with parallel processing, some meshes have been analyzed again using different number of processors. In this case, the simulation has been performed until the end of phase 1 (step 50). Considering the meshes used here (see 
                        Table 2), for all the approximation orders, increasing the number of processors reduces significantly the processing time, as expected.

Finally, in order to check the performance of the elements in the near-incompressibility situation, the present problem has been analyzed with different elastic parameters: Λ=369230.83 and µ=73.8511. These coefficients correspond to a Young modulus of E=221.5385 and a Poisson's ratio of ν=0.4999. The elements of linear order present severe locking even for a large number of elements, and the cubic and fourth-order elements suffices for this example (see 
                        Table 3 and 
                        Fig. 13).

The same block of the last example (see Fig. 8) has been numerically analyzed via displacement control. The material, in this case, is a dual phase steel with the following properties [1]:

                         is the vertical displacement (along direction x
                        1) at the end of each phase.

According to 
                        Table 4, the linear tetrahedral element is not able to run this problem using any mesh density. Again, locking disappears when high order polynomials are employed and convergence is achieved by improving the mesh density. 
                        Fig. 14 shows the applied pressure regarding the imposed displacement. Two distributions of the isotropic hardening parameter, see Eqs. (31) and (35), are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 15.

The fifth example is a prismatic beam under a prescribed vertical displacement (see 
                        Fig. 16). The beam is composed of mild steel, and the material data have been extracted from [1]. Due to the symmetry regarding the plane x
                        2=0.0, only a half of the beam is discretized. Four different discretizations with tetrahedral elements have been adopted: 18, 36, 72 and 144. As in the other examples, the approximation order varies from one to four. The objective of simulating this example is to compare the hyperelastoplastic and Green–Naghdi models (see Section 3) for structural problems with large displacements and small strains.

Regarding displacements, the influence of the mesh refinement on the beam behavior is depicted in 
                        Table 5. One can note that the meshes of linear elements present severe locking. A displacement comparison between the hyperelastoplastic model and the Green–Naghdi elastoplastic model can be seen in 
                        Fig. 17. From this result one concludes that the meshes with 144 tetrahedral elements of linear degree have presented severe locking; and the reaction forces are almost the same for the quadratic, cubic and fourth order tetrahedral elements. These facts indicate that, for small strains, the two models are equivalent. Moreover, the simulation of this problem with the Green–Naghdi formulation provides a processing time slightly smaller when compared to the hyperelastoplastic formulation (see Table 5). The final distribution of the isotropic hardening parameter κ, for both models (see Eqs. (35) and (49)), are also equivalent, as depicted in 
                        Fig. 18.

The last numerical example, extracted from [48] and proposed by [49], is the upsetting of a cylindrical metallic specimen (see 
                        Fig. 19). According to the first reference, in this problem, large compressive strains and mesh distortion take place. Due to the symmetry regarding the planes x
                        1=0.0, x
                        2=0.0 and x
                        3=0.0, only one eighth of the cylinder is discretized. To simulate this example, 72 tetrahedral finite elements with variable approximation order have been employed.

In order to show the convergence analysis of the problem by increasing the element order, the total reaction force versus the applied displacement is depicted in 
                        Fig. 20. Final distributions of the vertical displacement (u
                        3) and the plastic strain component (Ep)33 are showed in 
                        
                        Figs. 21 and 22.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Tetrahedral high order finite elements have been proposed to solve elastoplastic problems developing large strains. Two main constitutive models have been implemented and tested. The first is a general hyperelastoplastic model based mainly on the works of [22] and [23]. The second is a simplification for small strains, based on the works of [11,15] and [16]. By comparisons one can easily note the differences between the two formulations and, therefore, discard the second model for large strain applications. As the processing time for the second model is slightly smaller, this formulation can be used to analyze beams, plates and shells, in which finite deformation and small strains take place.

The tetrahedral elements are isoparametric of any-order based on the positional FEM. No alternative techniques (such as enhanced assumed strain method, reduced or selective integration and hourglass stabilization) are used. Regarding the numerical approximation, the main hypothesis employed here is that the use of high order elements avoids locking problems. As the increase in the number of processors reduces the processing time significantly, the use of high order elements is enabled by parallel processing. Moreover, we achieved our task by an important convergence analysis demonstrating that using high order elements the error control for practical large strain elastoplastic applications is feasible. According to the numerical examples, mesh refinement improves the convergence regarding displacements and plastic variables, such as plastic strains, backstress and isotropic hardening parameter. Therefore, the objective of finding a precise stress distribution inside solids under large elastoplastic strains has been achieved. The formulation can be used for further developments, such as the implementation of anisotropic models, non-associative flow rules and contact algorithms.

As expected, the use of the hyperelastoplastic consistent tangent operator improves the convergence, reducing the number of iterations and the processing time. Another point to be highlighted is the fact that, in the near-incompressibility situation, the meshes of linear degree present severe locking, even for a large number of elements, and the cubic and fourth orders suffices for this situation.
