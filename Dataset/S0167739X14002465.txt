                  Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs) have recently received a great deal of attention in the scientific and developers communities due to the significant advances of this technology in the wireless communication field. The main reason was that competing WMSN approaches that emerged in the last few years provide mesh capabilities (

                     ., robustness, scalability, multi-hop mesh routing, or energy efficiency, among others) to conventional WSN-based applications, encouraging researchers and end users to adopt new perspectives and solutions. Unfortunately, each one of these approaches lacks some (or many) of the aforementioned mesh capabilities, not assuring, a priori, the feasibility and, especially, the long-term stability of WMSN applications. The IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode was conceived to fill this gap since it integrates, in a single solution, most of these capabilities, guaranteeing, among other benefits, a long network lifetime. However, the ASES mode has no built-in mechanisms to mitigate the negative effects of hidden terminals, which sharply degrades the network performance. This fact leads us to conclude that any current WMSN approach is non-exempt of some problem, which prevents the definitive boost of this technology in the consumer market. Under these circumstances, our contribution to the WMSN field in this paper is a twofold proposal addressed to alleviating the hidden terminal problems in a scenario running under the most relevant design premises of ASES mode. Therefore, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization and then solve it by using Goal Programming. Both mathematical techniques are applied to obtain the best solution that simultaneously minimizes the aggregate message collision time due to hidden terminals and maximizes the network lifetime. Secondly, we propose the design of a MULti-channel TIme-scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance (MULTI-HIT) which appropriately exploits the available bandwidth and accomplishes a straightforward coordination between any sender–receiver pair. Finally, the analysis and simulation experiments are presented and their results carefully discussed, demonstrating the effectiveness of both proposals in the WMSN arena.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wireless Mesh Sensor Networks (WMSNs) comprise a technological field that has arisen as the natural evolution from the conventional Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), composed of only a few nodes, to large-scale networks in which sources and destinations are interconnected through different paths of intermediate nodes forming a mesh layout  [1]. To this end, new mesh capabilities such as multi-hop mesh routing, scalability, robustness, reliability, self-organization or energy efficiency must be satisfied  [2]. In this sense, advances in WMSNs over the next few years will be addressed to the design, development and integration of all these capabilities into a single standard mesh solution which, in turn, will ensure a strong boost of this technology in a wide range of areas, such as automation and control (home and industrial), environmental surveillance, precision agriculture, traffic monitoring, or health services  [1].

Concerning the mesh capabilities mentioned above, we pay special attention to energy efficiency since it is considered as one of the major issues in WMSN nodes usually fed by conventional (chemical) batteries. This is because many of the network nodes must accomplish a twofold functionality: (i) acquire and dispatch physical information of the surrounding area and (ii) relay appropriately the data from other different source nodes. Under these circumstances, the Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mechanism defined by the IEEE 802.15.5 standard is an operational mode conceived to reduce the power consumption of the WMSN nodes. To achieve this purpose, ASES integrates, in a single solution, an efficient duty-cycle strategy for saving energy along with most of the above mesh capabilities. This fact makes IEEE 802.15.5 standard and its ASES mechanism advantageous with respect to other WMSN approaches  [2], such as Zigbee Pro  [3], the International Engineering Task Force (IETF) with its solution IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)  [4], WirelessHART  [5] or ISA SP100.11a  [6].

However, ASES mode is not free from problems, one of the main ones being, in our opinion, that it prevents the definitive penetration of this solution in the consumer market: the hidden terminal (HT) effect. The HT phenomena occur when two (or more) sender nodes which are unable to sense each other transmit simultaneously, provoking message collisions at one or several common receiver nodes. This event leads to retransmitting the message/-s that suffered a collision, which greatly increases the energy devoted to transmitting/receiving a message successfully. Furthermore, if further collisions by HT also affect the retransmissions, it may occur that messages are finally discarded; therefore not reaching the receiver. This situation, extended to the overall WMSN, results in a dramatic increase in the number of messages lost, which may entail a strong deterioration of the network operation. Thereby, the inability of plain ASES to mitigate the HT effects together with the fact that the remaining WMSN solutions only satisfy an incomplete set of mesh capabilities is the reason that has motivated this work. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical model and a multi-channel time-slotted algorithm. Both proposals are aimed at alleviating the HT problems in a WMSN running under the most relevant premises of ASES mode, which assures, among other issues, a longer lifetime operation.

Therefore, as a first contribution of this research work, we introduce a multi-objective (MO) optimization problem  [7], which allows us to formulate multiple objectives in a single problem definition, in order to later apply the mathematical tool denoted as Goal Programming (GP)  [8,9] to simultaneously satisfy the objectives pursued. Prior to the definition of the MO problem objectives, we have to decide the most appropriate constraints that approximate the work here proposed to the real network operation. To this end, we derive the mathematical equations of the achieved throughput per link (total bitrate between a pair of nodes) and the energy consumption associated to each node. Furthermore, the hidden terminals effect along with some design premises of the ASES mode is also modeled in the formulation of the constraints. As objectives of the MO problem, we select: (i) the aggregate message collision time, denoted as the total ineffective time lost by collisions produced by HT problems, and (ii) the network lifetime, defined as the minimum node lifetime for any node belonging to the network. Interestingly, the simultaneous optimization of both objectives ensures a suitable throughput per link due to the decrease in the number of messages lost by collisions and, in turn, extends the network lifetime.

Among all the existing MO optimization techniques, we decided on Goal Programming to solve the problem formulated. Unlike more conventional optimization approaches (i.e., single-objective, sequential-objectives or other MO techniques)  [7], GP offers an adjustable model to real network operation conditions, combining, on the one hand, simplicity of formulation expressing constrains usually as linear/non-linear programming, and, on the other hand, flexibility to compute the optimal solution thanks to simultaneously optimizing the deviations (underachieve/overachieve) of estimations (called goals) about real (domain-driven applications) conditions. These deviations become the objectives of the optimization problem. In order to obtain the best performance of the WMSN, we numerically estimated the goals for the aggregate message collision time and network lifetime metrics which are consistent with the operation of some real scenarios related to agriculture applications where our group has wide experience  [10,11]. The numerical results obtained by GP clearly satisfy the deviations of these goals, thus setting an optimal design in order to reach an efficient and complete sensing monitoring during, at least, the period specified by the end users for the WMSN applications under consideration. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first work in the scientific literature that provides a solution based on Goal Programming in order to improve the WMSNs performance under hidden terminal interference.

As a second contribution of this paper, we present the design of a MULti-channel TIme-scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance, which we call MULTI-HIT. This new algorithm, based on the design principles of the ASES mode operation, is conceived to mitigate the HT problems in a WMSN. To this end, we first take into consideration the studies in  [12–14], which allow us to learn about the strong points and limitations of the different techniques that cope with the HT effects in WSNs and WMSNs. These techniques are classified into four main categories, namely, time-slot scheduling mechanisms, channel multiplexing protocols, directional antenna techniques and, CDMA-based proposals. Among them, we propose a solution which follows some of the rules related to channel multiplexing  [15] and time-slot scheduling  [16,17] techniques, and does not require additional and costly hardware, as it is the case of proposals that employ CDMA-based or directional antenna methodologies. On the contrary, MULTI-HIT implements a straightforward schedule for the nodes transmission/reception tasks while making an efficient use of the multiple frequency channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. The final result is a clear reduction in the energy and computing/memory resources required in comparison with solutions based on CDMA or directional antennas.

The MULTI-HIT scheme is also evaluated by means of computer simulation, comparing its performance results with the ones obtained by (i) the optimization study and (ii) a recent approach denoted as Quorum-based energy-efficient Medium Access Control protocol (Queen-MAC)  [12]. This scheme has already been validated by the scientific community and also combines channel multiplexing and time scheduling techniques, thus sharing common features with our MULTI-HIT proposal. Therefore, it seems appropriate to judge Queen-MAC against MULTI-HIT, though, as will be discussed, its performance is shown to be worse. In contrast, the multi-objective study and MULTI-HIT proposal exhibit similar network performance in terms of throughput and network lifetime, which demonstrates the effectiveness of both works when dealing with the HT problem in the WMSN arena.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section  2 we review the related work, paying special attention to the studies in which the HT phenomena are modeled analytically. An overview of the ASES mode is provided in Section  3. In Section  4, the optimization problem is formulated and solved by means of the goal programming multi-objective technique, and the results obtained are thoroughly examined. MULTI-HIT is described in detail in Section  5. Section  6 presents an intensive performance evaluation study in which the optimization model and simulation frameworks are comparatively discussed. Finally, Section  7 concludes the paper.

A methodical review of the scientific literature shows many investigations that take into consideration the hidden terminal problem in the WSN field. Among them, we highlight those relevant surveys  [15–20] which overview the current state of the art regarding technological solutions that offer some hints to alleviate this issue. Additionally, in this section we present a set of proposals which provide a further study on the HT problem in large-scale WSN scenarios. They have been divided into two groups. Firstly, those remarkable analytical works that characterize and evaluate the HT phenomenon, in order to later quantify it with the aim of understanding its importance  [21–23]. Secondly, up-to-date studies that provide solutions to mitigate the HT problem  [12,13], employing the same design principles proposed by our work, that is, the group comprising multi-channel  [15] and time-slot scheduling  [16,17] techniques.

Regarding the first group, we start by inspecting works  [21,22], which carried out a meticulous study of the HT problems in the non-beacon mode of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard  [24]. We draw our attention to these works because the IEEE 802.15.5 standard and, therefore, its ASES mechanism, use the underlying IEEE 802.15.4 standard, in particular, its non-beacon mode, to access the physical medium. Thereby, in the work of Di Marco et al.  [21], a general analytical model referred to this operation mode is presented and validated by extensive computational simulations. The aims of this investigation were the study of the effects provoked by hidden terminals in a multi-hop network, and the demonstration of the accuracy of the proposed model by means of a careful comparison with the results obtained by a simulation framework. To achieve these purposes, the authors modeled each node through a single M/G/1/K queue, thus under Poisson input traffic. In addition, to conduct a complete study of the network performance, the authors set different traffic loads. Under these assumptions, throughput, latency, frame delivery ratio, and energy consumption at each node are calculated. In particular, results in  [21] demonstrate that network performance is significantly degraded by the HT phenomenon. A notable limitation of the proposed model lies in the computation time required by the simulation framework, especially, as the number of network nodes increases. To solve this concern in large-scale networks, the authors devised and validated (by means of computer simulation) new analytical expressions which pursue the same goal as the general model, but reducing significantly the high computational effort demanded by topologies with a large number of nodes.

Following with the IEEE 802.15.4 non-beacon mode, the research accomplished by Samaras et al.  [22] presents an analytical study which evaluates, in terms of throughput and latency, the performance of a network in presence of hidden terminals. Each node is modeled by means of an M/G/1 queue and, as in  [21], the traffic generation pattern follows a Poisson distribution under different traffic loads. Samaras et al. validated their proposal by means of extensive ns-2 simulations and demonstrated its accuracy comparing the results obtained with analytical solutions published in the scientific literature  [25,26]. However, unlike the study carried out by Di Marco et al., authors in  [22] did not report results referred to the computational burden required by the analytical model resolution, especially, in the case in which the number of nodes is big. Furthermore, the procedure proposed by Samaras et al. in  [22] is restricted to multi-tier single-hop hierarchical networks (i.e., cluster-tree topology), while the work of Di Marco et al.  [21] can be extended to other topologies as the mesh one.

To finish with the related analytical studies, the work in  [23] measures quantitatively the effect of hidden nodes in a WSN for several scenarios (single-hop, grid, random). This fact is accomplished by analyzing a straightforward mathematical model satisfying, among others, the next two assertions: (i) each node is characterized by an M/M/1/K queue, and (ii) the traffic rates follow the same criteria as those defined by studies  [21,22]. Furthermore, this analytical study assesses the performance metrics delay, throughput and energy consumption at each node. Then the model is validated by computer simulation. Results demonstrated the negative effects of the hidden terminal problem in WSNs, which significantly degrade the network operation. In this paper, we take our inspiration from the investigation in  [23] to devise our multi-objective optimization problem extended to the WMSN field.

As regards solutions that alleviate the hidden terminal phenomenon, we highlight the recent studies in  [12,13]. Authors of  [12] presented a quorum-based approach, denoted as Quorum-based energy-efficient MAC protocol (Queen-MAC). In this protocol, time is divided into slots of fixed size, each of them dedicated exclusively to transmissions between two nodes (a sender–receiver pair) in radio coverage. In particular, a node must reserve an appropriate number of slots to send data to each of its neighbors in accordance with its own requirements of traffic load. This fact means that nodes closer to the sink/base station need to reserve more slots than, for instance, leaf nodes (usually the most remote devices from the sink/base station and/or end devices) as the sink’s neighbors handle a large amount of messages (its own data traffic plus the one generated by farther nodes that has to be relayed). Thereby, Queen-MAC gives the network nodes the ability to learn about the time periods (slots) in which they must listen to the medium for receiving ongoing transmissions from their neighbors, and about the periods in which the nodes under consideration must switch to the sleep state.

Concerning the multi-channel feature of Queen-MAC protocol, four frequency channels are assigned to each node: two for broadcast transmission/reception, and two more for unicast transmission/reception. This enables simultaneous data transmissions, that is, two senders belonging to a same interfering area and using the same slot can dispatch information to two receivers since they operate in separate channels, increasing the bandwidth utilization. In addition, the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) mechanism, commonly used in IEEE 802.11-based networks  [27], is also employed right before exchanging data/acknowledgment (ack) messages. Queen-MAC is evaluated by means of computer simulation, showing a good performance in terms of network lifetime and message delivery ratio. Nevertheless, Queen-MAC exhibits some significant shortcomings. One of its main disadvantages lies in the use of the RTS/CTS mechanism. Translated to the WSN and WMSN fields, these signaling messages imply more energy consumption in nodes and extra control overhead  [28,29]. Furthermore, as stated in  [29], the RTS/CTS mechanism does not resolve completely the HT problems in multi-hop networks. Another limitation of Queen-MAC is that broadcast traffic can only flow from the sink node to the remaining network nodes. Therefore, Queen-MAC cannot be employed in those applications where broadcast transmissions  [30] and/or multicast transmissions  [31] are accomplished by any arbitrary network node.

Finally, in  [13], network nodes implement a learning mechanism at the network formation phase in which nodes determine the number and the position of the slots required for transmitting/receiving information. This learning mechanism leads to a decision making process by all network nodes which must decide, at each slot, whether they transmit their data, listen for ongoing transmissions from neighbors, or switch to the sleep state to save energy. Going into detail, every sender node has to compete with its neighbors to reserve a precise number of slots that guarantee the delivery of its traffic load. In this sense and as indicated in the Queen-MAC procedure, each slot only allows the data transaction between a sender–receiver pair. Once these slots are reserved, the intended receiver/-s must remain listening in the same sender’s channel, which assures a successful data transaction between them. Similarly, the rest of sender’s neighbors must learn about these reserved slots, switching to another channel different from the one selected by the sender under consideration in the case that they have data to dispatch or, otherwise, returning to the sleep state. Thereby, the learning process continues until all nodes operate in a collision-free state. On the other hand, to obtain a multi-channel coordination, nodes run a pseudorandom algorithm which resolves, by means of the sender’s address, the channel to tune in each slot. This technique is also employed in other multi-channel proposals such as the ones in  [32,33], and it has been adopted in our design as well. Following with the work in  [13], simulation experiments showed an appropriate network performance in terms of message delivery ratio, latency and energy consumption. Nevertheless, the time required for all network nodes to converge to a collision-free state may be long enough, provoking a notable energy waste during this initial stage. Additionally, this protocol requires a tight synchronization of the entire network by means of the periodic transmission of synchronization messages, which significantly increases the network overhead.

Energy efficiency is considered as one of the paramount design requirements in WSNs and WMSNs. The reason lies in that sensor devices are typically equipped with a small number of chemical batteries of limited capacity and placed at isolated locations where, in many occasions, no external energy sources are available. In addition, these locations may be of difficult access (e.g., in steep forested lands) for the end user/operator making the replacement of the batteries, once they are depleted, expensive and even impossible. Under these circumstances, the implementation of energy-saving mechanisms becomes an issue of utmost importance since a suitable design should entail a long operation of the WMSN. To deal with this concern, the IEEE 802.15.5 LR-WPAN mesh standard incorporates the Asynchronous Energy Saving (ASES) mode  [2,34]. In ASES, sensor nodes usually remain in a state of inactivity operating with extremely low power consumption (OFF) most of the time, and they switch periodically to a state of full activity (ON) during a short period only to transmit/receive data. This ON/OFF schedule, commonly called duty cycle, allows a reduction in the energy waste of nodes and, as a consequence, an extension of the network lifetime to months or even years, depending on the type of intended application and the user’s requirements.

ASES denotes the periods of activity (ON) and inactivity (OFF) as Active Duration (AD) and Inactive Duration (ID), respectively. Both periods comprise one duty cycle, referred to as the Wakeup Interval (WI). The expressions to calculate the value for the WI and AD periods are shown in Eq. (1):

                        ≤
                      AO

                        ≤
                      14. In particular, the IEEE 802.15.5 standard recommends that all nodes should be configured with the same WI value, though the length of the AD may be different for each network node.

Communications in ASES mode are asynchronous. This means that, to achieve a suitable unicast message transmission process, a receiver must remain in its corresponding AD when a sender dispatches a data message to it. To this end, at the beginning of the AD, every network node always announces, to all its one-hop neighbors in coverage range (potential senders) and by means of a Wakeup Notification (WN) message, that it is ready to receive data. Thereby, those one-hop neighbors interested in sending information to a same receiver must wait as maximum a time interval equal to one WI for the reception of the WN. Once the WN message is received, one-hop neighbors compete for the physical medium employing the unslotted CSMA-CA procedure, which is in compliance with the design rules proposed by the IEEE 802.15.4 medium access control (MAC) layer. Fig. 1
                     (a) illustrates the unicast transmission mode. In particular, the figure exemplifies the case in which the ADs of both sender and receiver do not overlap, that is, the receiver initiates its AD when the sender still remains in sleep state, and vice versa. To accomplish the data transmission appropriately, the sender must extend its AD (listening to the medium) until reception of the WN from the receiver.

Following with the unicast transmission mode, ASES provides a mechanism that guarantees the success of the data transmission when a short duration of the receiver’s AD prevents the data transaction with the sender. This mechanism consists of taking advantage of the information included within the WN messages, in particular, the values of the AO and WO parameters configured by the receiver. This information allows the sender node to calculate the duration of the receiver’s AD. Therefore, in the case that the obtained result confirms the ability of the receiver’s AD to receive data, the sender runs the transmission as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Otherwise, if the receiver’s AD expires before completing the reception of the message, the sender performs the mechanism depicted in Fig. 1(b) to ensure its reception. In this figure, the sender again waits for the reception of the WN message extending its AD. After receiving the WN, the sender requests for the extension of the receiver’s AD by transmitting an Extension Request (EREQ) message. Upon reception of the EREQ message, the receiver extends its AD, and confirms the EREQ arrival to the sender by means of an Extension Reply (EREP) message. When the sender receives the EREP message, it dispatches the data message. Finally, note that ASES allows broadcast transmissions (Fig. 1(c)) as well. In this transmission mode, the sender requires all neighbors in its coverage area (potential receivers) to be in active mode to receive data. To achieve it, the sender broadcasts consecutive EREQ messages during a time interval longer than one WI. This procedure ensures that each neighbor receives the EREQ messages when it wakes up, remaining in the reception mode until the sender ends the transmission of EREQ messages and broadcasts the data message.

In any of the above transmission modes, ASES is aimed at ensuring, a priori, the delivery of data at receiver/destination. To this end, sender nodes proceed to retransmit those messages (in accordance with the transmission modes shown in Fig. 1) which suffered some incident (e.g., collisions). Each message retransmission is completed in a consecutive WI, up to a maximum number of retries established by the standard. Thus, if a message is successfully delivered at the first attempt, then the sender initiates the transmission process for a new data message. Otherwise, if this process fails, the sender retransmits the data message during the next WI, thus consuming a second attempt. In case of reaching the maximum number of retries, the data message is discarded.

As shown, ASES mode is conceived as an energy-saving mechanism for WMSNs due to its efficient duty-cycle strategy. Nevertheless, ASES does not have any mechanism to solve other significant concerns as the hidden terminals problem. This phenomenon may provoke a large amount of collisions which, in turn, increase the number of retransmissions and, as a consequence, the messages lost. Collisions due to hidden terminals can be classified into two groups  [35]: primary and secondary collisions. Primary collisions occur when two or more senders that are out of each other’s coverage range (hidden terminals) transmit to a same receiver which is within the coverage range of the senders, incurring in discarding all colliding messages at the receiver. Similarly, secondary collisions are caused by senders which (i) are hidden terminals to each other and (ii) transmit simultaneously to different receivers, being one of these receivers in coverage range with all the senders. The receiver under consideration experiences the collision of messages transmitted by senders, discarding them and requiring their retransmissions. In any case, the hidden terminal problem is an important shortcoming since retransmissions and further messages lost notably degrade the network performance in terms of throughput, message delivery ratio and energy consumption, among others.

In this section, we formulate an analytical model to study the performance of a WMSN under the hidden terminal effects, assessing several figures of merit, such as the average power consumption per node, the aggregate throughput at the sink station (total bitrate of all network links) or the message collision time per link. To achieve this purpose, we focus on the multi-objective programming techniques because, through the definition of a single formulation problem, MO methods allow us to obtain the best results for a set of WMSN design parameters. In particular, we pursue a twofold objective: (i) maximize the network lifetime, thus extending the WMSN operation and (ii) minimize the aggregate message collision time parameter defined as the total time lost by message collisions owing to HT. As will be demonstrated, a low value of this last parameter alleviates the HT effects, which, in turn, implies a reduction in the number of messages lost. We choose Goal Programming (GP) as the MO technique to optimize both parameters simultaneously.

To simplify the multi-objective problem, we take into account the following assumptions: 
                        
                           i.
                           All nodes are static in the network.

The application requires data to be disseminated periodically from any network node to a unique sink.

Any node may transmit data to its neighbors in coverage area (one-hop neighbors) closer to the sink.

Nodes operate in accordance with a duty-cycle strategy similar to the one defined by ASES mode, selecting the same values for the Wakeup Interval and Active Duration. Unlike ASES operation, the AD is divided into time slots of 10 ms each, which allows the transmission of a single data message between a sender–receiver pair.

Nodes are completely synchronized with their neighbors in coverage area.

All nodes have the same capabilities (single battery of limited capacity, and a half-duplex radio configured with a fixed transmission range) excepting the sink, whose power source is considered as unlimited.

The wireless channel is noise-free and there is direct connectivity among a node and its one-hop neighbors.

The optimization process finalizes when one or several nodes exhaust their energy-constrained capacities.

Assumptions (i) and (ii) are geared toward domain-driven applications such as structural health monitoring of civil infrastructure  [36], or more particularly precision agriculture, where our group has wide experience  [10,37]. Assumption (i) is mainly motivated by two reasons. First, in many such data-collection applications, WMSN nodes have to be placed at static locations that are usually determined by the monitoring objectives (e.g., wall inclination, relative humidity, plant shape, or soil moisture). Second, physical-space constraints (e.g., obstacles such as walls, and pillars)  [38,39] impose strict restrictions in the application management, such as the impossibility of using relay/sink mobility to improve the network performance. Similarly, Assumption (ii) copes with the premises of data monitoring in the aforementioned domain-driven applications, where physical sensing information is collected and reported periodically. For example, in precision agriculture, soil moisture measurements are usually scheduled to be transmitted at periodic intervals ranging from few minutes to several hours  [10]. Furthermore, due again to typical restrictions in the application requirements, we rely on the use of a unique sink/gateway, which is in charge of transferring the received data to a central management server via the Internet through an Ethernet-based connection or other suitable communication technology (e.g., 3G/4G).

Regarding Assumption (iv), it helps reducing the number of collisions by means of an appropriate scheduling for the message transmissions of nodes. As regards Assumption (v), it is devoted to successfully achieve the scheduling proposed by Assumption (iv). To this end, we take advantage of the local synchronization approaches proposed by studies as  [12,40], where nodes share their clock with neighbors in coverage area. Finally, Assumption (vii) seeks, on the one hand, to avoid messages lost due to radio propagation errors and, on the other hand, to guarantee the connectivity between a node and each one of its one-hop neighbors while any other arbitrary network node can act as hidden terminal. This assumption, together with the regular grid mesh topology selected in this paper for our numerical and simulation campaigns, allows us to isolate HT problems from other interference sources. In this regard, it is worth remarking that this same consideration is adopted in the work of Cano et al.  [23] with identical objective: to eliminate the influence of interference sources other than hidden terminals in order to obtain an appropriate quantification of the HT impact.

As indicated, two metrics are jointly optimized in our model: the network lifetime and the aggregate message collision time. To this goal, in the following subsections, we describe how to characterize the throughput per link and the energy consumption at each node considering hidden terminal problems in order to later formulate our multi-objective optimization.

To calculate the throughput under HT conditions, we take inspiration from the work of Cano et al.  [23], where the HT problem in a WSN is undertaken. Unlike the work of Cano et al., we include diverse design premises of the IEEE 802.15.5 standard in the throughput characterization, which provide a more realistic study of the WMSN requirements.

For the sake of simplicity, we model each sensor node as a single M/G/1 queue operating under FIFO service discipline, Poisson input traffic of average rate 
                           λ
                         messages per second, and mean service time 
                           
                              
                                 
                                    
                                       S
                                    
                                    
                                       t
                                    
                                 
                              
                              ¯
                           
                        . This queuing model could be applied because, in a mesh network, the possibility to finally send/receive a message depends on multiple factors, such as the access to the medium and the communications available in the vicinity. In addition, we consider that nodes access the physical medium by making use of the unslotted CSMA-CA mechanism as defined by the IEEE 802.15.5 standard  [41]. That is, each node firstly delays its transmission a backoff time

                         and then executes the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) operation in order to determine whether the medium is free to dispatch the message. The time

In this subsection, we formulate the energy model under HT conditions. It is based on the duty-cycle scheme proposed in ASES mechanism consisting of a period of activity (Active Duration) plus a period of inactivity (Inactive Duration), which comprises a single Wakeup Interval. The values of the WI and the AD are given by Eq. (1) shown in Section  3. However, in accordance with Assumption (iv), the AD is divided into slots of

                                    slot

                         duration each. Considering this new premise, and, for the sake of clarity, we define three types of slots (wakeup, reception and unassigned time slots) as follows.
                           Definition 1
                           Wakeup Time Slot


                           The time slot in which a receiver node transmits a Wakeup Notification message to notify its one-hop neighbors of its availability to receive data messages. It corresponds to the first slot within a node’s AD (e.g., time slot 0 as depicted in Fig. 3).


                        
                           Definition 2
                           Reception Time Slot


                           The time slot allocated by a receiver node within its AD to a single one-hop neighbor in coverage interested in transmitting a message (e.g., time slots 1–4 as depicted in Fig. 3).


                        
                           Definition 3
                           Unassigned Time Slot


                           The time slot within a receiver node’s AD which has not been allocated to any one-hop neighbor (e.g., time slots 5–7 as depicted in Fig. 3).

Our proposed duty-cycle mechanism obeys the following rules. After transmission of the WN during the wakeup slot, every network node allocates at least one reception slot to each one-hop neighbor for data exchange. If the AD is long enough, i.e., the number of one-hop neighbors of a node is less than the number of reception slots, then there are a number of readily available unassigned slots which may be reserved by neighbors on demand for forthcoming transmissions. The latter is let to relax our initial Assumption (ii), thus providing our mechanism with greater flexibility in order to give support to event-driven services with higher bandwidth demands. Under these conditions, a node remains in reception mode during the reception slots waiting for incoming messages; otherwise the radio transceiver is switched to sleep mode to save energy during unassigned slots. This procedure implies that nodes acting as senders must carry out the data transmission within the ID. In this period, senders remain usually in sleep state until they have to transmit a data message to any of their one-hop neighbors. When this occurs, nodes wake up at the reception slot assigned within the intended neighbor’s AD and dispatch their data message. Then, senders return to the sleep state.

The total energy consumption of an arbitrary sensor node 
                        
                           i
                         can be derived as the sum of four terms, as shown in Eq. (8): (i) the energy consumed by transmission tasks, (ii) the energy wasted in receiving messages, (iii) the energy consumed by the idle mode, and (iv) the energy spent in the sleep state.

Taking into account Expression (9), the total energy wasted by the transmission task can be computed as indicated by Eq. (10). In this equation, we quantify the average energy consumption of a node when it wakes up, as well as the energy consumed for sending, on the one hand, the WN messages within their wakeup slots, and, on the other hand, the

                         data messages.

                        ) performing tasks different from transmission, data reception and sleep within the AD. Eq. (14) computes the energy consumption of a node 
                           i
                         in sleep mode, both in the AD (unassigned slots) and in the ID, which involves minimal memory and processing demands. In particular, the sleep state during the ID is only interrupted when a node must send a message or when its AD starts.

Eqs. (19) and (20) introduce the problem objectives. On the one hand, the minimization of the aggregate message collision time parameter entails a clear reduction of the number of messages lost between a node and its one-hop neighbors under hidden terminal conditions which in turn involves an increase of the throughput per link. On the other hand, the maximization of the

                         allows us to extend the useful life/operation of the network.

Finally, Expressions (21)–(26) comprise the linear/non-linear constraints for the network lifetime and the aggregate message collision time joint optimization problem. Note that these expressions include, among others, premises of the ASES functionality and the hidden terminals effect. Details of these equations are as follows:

Multi-objective optimization allows us to formulate both objectives in the same problem definition. Then, we can apply several mathematical techniques to solve the problem formulated. In particular, we select Goal Programming   [8,9]. As any other optimization technique, GP is used to introduce estimations (denoted as goals) about real network conditions into the constraints of the problem. However, the key point of GP lies in its capacity to simultaneously optimize the deviations (underachieve/overachieve) of these goals, expressing problems usually based on linear/non-linear MO programming. GP fulfills the target of finding a practical, real-world solution to a problem, transforming the objectives into goals. To this end, the decision makers, through a preliminary study, estimate the expected result for that goal.

The idea behind distinguishing GP from other more conventional methods of optimization (i.e., single-objective, sequential-objectives or other MO techniques  [42–45]) is to introduce flexibility into the objective functions (as opposed to the rigid constraints of the conventional techniques). Most of the traditional approaches to real-world decision problems rely on models that usually presume the optimization of objectives subject to a set of rigid constraints  [46–48]. This fact may imply a significant deviation of results versus the expected ones. GP is an attempt to eliminate or, at least, relax this concern by offering simpler problem formulation and more feasibility to compute the optimal solution. The result is a more adjustable model to real network operation conditions. This explains why GP is the selected multi-objective decision making tool in a large number of scientific disciplines  [9], among them, the WSNs field  [11].

Thereby, applying the principles of goal programming formulation shown in Eq. (27), our initial multi-objective optimization problem must be transformed in the equations that simultaneously minimize the aggregate message collision time and maximize the network lifetime. Thus, Problems (19)–(26) are now re-formulated accordingly as follows:

Finally, for any new scenario under study, the solution of Eqs. (28)–(29) returns the achieved throughput of all network links. In detail, we can observe that the outcome given by solving Problems (28)–(29) leads to an appropriate throughput per link which implies suitable results for the data gathered at the base station.

                        , we consider a low value for the aggregate message collision time (800 ms) with the aim of minimizing the number of collisions occurred in the network. Thereby, we pursue that the highest number of messages reaches the sink successfully and the power consumption is mainly devoted to delivering these messages.

                        , we estimate, a priori, the value of six months. This value takes into consideration the maximum period of time for replacing the batteries of sensor devices working in diverse realistic scenarios such as a forest area (data collected by the Council of Environment and Territory Management of the Murcia Region) or in a high variety of farmlands/crops (e.g., melon, Cucumis melo L., or broccoli, Brassica oleracea, var. italic) located in the Campo de Cartagena (Southeast of Spain) and the surrounding area  [10,11].

To conduct our analytical study, a scenario composed of 49 nodes arranged in a regular 7 × 7 grid topology was set up. This layout is appropriate to study the HT phenomena because it allows us to isolate this issue from others (e.g., messages lost by CSMA-CA) and, as a result, the collision of the messages is mostly due to the interference provoked by communications in the vicinity. The distance (
                           d
                        ) between adjacent nodes is 50 m, and the maximum transmission range is defined by a circle of radius 60 m centered at each node, which allows it to reach its up, down, left and right one-hop neighbors. This involves that any arbitrary network node different from one-hop neighbors can act as hidden terminal. On the other hand, the sink node appointed to receive all network data is placed at the bottom left corner of the grid (node 1). The rest of nodes forward data messages by selecting their nearest one-hop neighbor to the sink. Regarding the power-consumption evaluation, we have opted for the energy model of TelosB devices  [49]. Details of the energy model of TelosB along with the values of the remaining design parameters are written in Table 2

                        , are satisfied simultaneously. In particular, Fig. 2(a) and (b) illustrates that the aggregate message collision time and the throughput per link increase as the amount of data injected to the network approaches to the sink. This is because the traffic load is higher in nodes closer to the sink than in farther nodes, which, in turn, implies a greater number of collisions in the sink’s neighbors placed at one-hop due to HT problems. However, the total time devoted to collisions is extremely low (in the order of milliseconds), which, in practice, means that most of the messages reach the sink (99.8%). This results in an acceptable aggregate throughput measured at the sink (6.85 kbps).

On the other hand, Fig. 2(c) depicts the average power consumption at each network node. As expected, the sink (despite having an unlimited energy source) and its one-hop neighbors suffer the greatest energy waste, since they handle higher traffic load. Therefore, those nodes are the first to exhaust their energy-constrained capacities. Under these circumstances and in order to achieve the maximum network lifetime, the power consumption of the sink’s neighbors (and the rest of the network nodes) is sharply reduced by the optimization process. This issue is satisfied without jeopardizing the minimum value obtained for the aggregate message collision time parameter.

Analyzing the three figures together, we can observe the excellent network performance obtained by solving the optimization model, regardless of the figure of merit to assess. In this regard, the analytical results obtained are revealed as appropriate bounds to compare when other theoretical (e.g., simulation frameworks) or realistic (e.g., test beds) approaches address the hidden terminal problem in WMSNs under the same conditions and requirements here presented.

The MULti-channel TIme-scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance (MULTI-HIT) proposed in this paper is aimed at mitigating the hidden terminal effects on a WMSN, taking into account the same assumptions and considerations imposed on our previous analytical model. To this end, our solution considers many design premises of the ASES mode, such as the adoption of a duty-cycle strategy based on a WI/AD scheme (following Eq. (1) in Section  3) or the transmission of WN messages. Nevertheless, unlike the ASES mode, our proposal employs jointly (1) a multi-channel switching mechanism and (2) a time-slot scheduling in order to furnish the medium access operations. Regarding (1), the IEEE 802.15.5 standard does not specify how to access the 16 frequency channels enabled by the physical (PHY) and MAC layers of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard  [41] for the 2.4 GHz ISM band. To face this concern, we take inspiration from the multi-channel protocols which have been extensively studied in the scientific literature  [14,15], designing a solution that consists of switching dynamically among different frequency channels (technique known as channel hopping). This assures a better exploitation of the total bandwidth available and provides robustness against interference from other wireless networks/technologies operating nearby (i.e., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or other WSNs/WMSNs)  [14,15]. However, the implementation of a multichannel approach is not enough to fully alleviate the hidden terminal problems, in particular, the primary collision cases. To solve this shortcoming, we complete our proposal with (2) a time-slotted scheme. Note that MULTI-HIT is conceived to accomplish similar network performance to the one obtained by our previous numerical solution, as will be demonstrated in Section  6.

The goal of providing multi-channel capability to MULTI-HIT is to avoid the secondary collisions due to hidden nodes. This translates in a clear improvement in the throughput per link metric because the number of simultaneous transmissions increases notably. To achieve this purpose, we start from reference works  [32,33] in order to design a pseudorandom algorithm which guarantees an efficient and straightforward multi-channel switching mechanism as well as the appropriate coordination between any sender–receiver pair, requiring in turn minimal computing resources on WMSN nodes. In our case, this algorithm must also indicate to each node the frequency channel to operate. In this regard, when a new AD begins, network nodes run the pseudorandom algorithm with a seed value to obtain a collision-free channel, and remain in it until the completion of the AD. The seed value must be different in network nodes belonging to a same interfering area where a node may be affected by hidden terminals. This involves that each node and those which may disrupt its operation select different channels, thus avoiding secondary collisions. In addition, for data transmissions, the seed value is always included within the WN messages. Thereby, a sender node will execute its pseudorandom algorithm with the same seed value as its intended receiver, thus knowing beforehand the channel in which its receiver wakes up. In our implementation, the pseudorandom algorithm which calculates a channel

                         at the next iteration. To establish the first communication between a sender–receiver pair, a sender node must employ an initial value for

                        , which is calculated from the receiver’s address. This assures that both, a sender and a receiver, operate in the same channel and, therefore, the sender receives the first WN of the intended receiver including the 
                           n
                         value which guarantees the data transmission in the following AD.

Despite the fact that nodes remain in different frequency channels, secondary collisions may still occur in the case that two (or more) nodes hidden to each other, and whose ADs are overlapped, select the same channel/-s to receive data. To deal with this concern, nodes compute the number of collisions per second experienced at each channel and per each one-hop neighbor (a node assumes that a collision occurred when, after sending a data message by using the unslotted CSMA-CA mechanism, it does not receive the corresponding ack frame from the receiver). This value is compared with the results obtained by our numerical solution, in particular, the aggregate message collision time per link divided by the network lifetime. Thereby, if the transmissions to a same receiver continuously fail regardless of the slot (the time-slotted scheme of MULTI-HIT is explained in the following subsections) and frequency channel selected (the measured collision time exceeds the one calculated by the optimization process), the sender includes the receiver in a probe list (as defined by IEEE 802.15.5 standard) and chooses a different one-hop neighbor for forthcoming data transmissions. Under this situation, the receiver included in the probe list is tested periodically by the sender through probe messages (very short control messages), being removed from the probe list if the new collision time calculated goes below the one indicated by our numerical solution.

The multi-channel functionality is only conceived to alleviate the number of messages lost due to secondary collisions. However, our multi-channel approach is unable to avoid, by itself, other important concerns in WMSNs as the primary collisions. In this sense, we have included a time-slotted strategy in MULTI-HIT which, on the one hand, eliminates the primary collisions and, on the other hand, helps the multi-channel mechanism further mitigate the negative effect of the secondary collisions, especially, in the case of dense networks, where the number of nodes within a same coverage area may be greater than the number of available channels. To this end, our time-slotted strategy is divided into three parts: (i) a synchronization algorithm, which is a mandatory requirement for any time-slotted protocol; (ii) a transmission schedule devoted to avoid primary collisions; and (iii) a reception schedule aimed at further reducing the secondary collisions.

One of the main key design issues in time-slotted approaches is the selection of an appropriate synchronization mechanism which allows sender–receiver pairs to wake up at the same time to accomplish their communication tasks. In a WMSN each device has its own notion of time through its internal clock. Individual nodes’ clock, even from the same manufacturer, may tick at slightly different rates due to minimum variations which occurred in the manufacturing process. Besides, changes in the temperature and/or the voltage supplied once nodes have been deployed in a monitoring area are other factors that have influence on different clock’s tick. The consequence is the increase in the clock drift among nodes over time (e.g., TelosB devices introduce, on average, a clock drift of 30 μs per second  [50]), leading to transmission errors (e.g., a message is received in a slot different from the one expected). Therefore, nodes must re-synchronize periodically to maintain the accuracy in data transmissions within each time slot.

In closer detail, our approach is based on a fully distributed scheme where a node synchronizes with all its one-hop neighbors through their WN messages (clock information is included in the payload of WNs). The idea behind this approach is that by performing a local synchronization (each node with its one-hop neighbors), a network-wide synchronization is also accomplished. To this end, a node which requires synchronizing with a particular one-hop neighbor must wait for the WN from the neighbor under consideration, and upon its reception, adjust its clock. Additionally, any receiver node always starts listening to the physical medium a short time before the node under consideration expects to receive a data message from a particular sender; and another short time after if it does not receive the message. Each of these short times, denoted as guard time duration (GTD), is typically set to 1 ms  [35,40]. Thus, a node must re-synchronize with a particular neighbor before the clock drift between both nodes exceeds the GTD (this clock drift is calculated considering the last synchronization accomplished).

The transmission schedule is conceived to address the primary collisions due to hidden nodes, with the intention that every network node (operating as receiver) coordinates the transmissions of all its one-hop neighbors within its AD. To this end, the AD is divided into fixed slots of 10 ms; time long enough to receive one data message of maximum size (127 bytes at physical layer), transmit the ack frame, and include the GTD for synchronization purposes. Thereby, MULTI-HIT adapts the operation of ASES mode to a time-slotted scheme as follows. Following the same considerations adopted in our energy model, every node always employs the first slot of its AD to transmit the WN message (wakeup slot), while the remaining slots are allocated to one-hop neighbors (potential senders) to receive data from them (reception slots). In particular, each one-hop neighbor has, at least, one time slot for its exclusive use. To accomplish this assignment, we take benefit from the mesh network formation phase defined by the IEEE 802.15.5 standard, where nodes share their routing tables with one-hop neighbors to generate local links with them  [41]. To this purpose, every node constructs a list with the addresses of those one-hop neighbors already stored in its routing table in order to later dispatch this information to every node in coverage area. Then, when a one-hop neighbor receives this message, it updates its routing table, and checks the position in which its network address appears in the list included in the message  [35]. The resulting value indicates to each one-hop neighbor the time slot that should be used to transmit data to the node under consideration. From this approach, it can be inferred that every node knows the one-hop neighbor which transmits in each slot.

To implement the transmission schedule, a relevant aspect must also be satisfied: the duration of the AD must contain a minimum number of 10 ms slots, which allow every node the transmission of its WN message, and the reception of, at least, a single data message from each one-hop neighbor. To explain this concern, we use the 3 × 3 grid topology shown in Fig. 3. In this topology and, as an example, we select the node labeled as 5 since it is the network node with the highest number of nodes in coverage area, in particular, four neighbors with identifiers 2, 4, 6 and 8. Thus, a minimum of five slots are required, one assigned to node 5 to transmit its WN message, and one for each one-hop neighbor. Now, we must set the duty cycle considering this minimum number of slots within the AD. According to Eq. (1), we can configure the AO parameter setting a value equal to or greater than 4. In our example, we set the AO parameter to 4, which results in an AD equal to 80 ms. Thereby, the AD is composed of a total of 8 slots of 10 ms each: one slot for node 5, and 7 slots available for its one-hop neighbors. This also means that, a priori, there are three unassigned slots within the AD of node 5.

Regarding unassigned slots, in the case that a particular WMSN application demands high traffic rates, MULTI-HIT allocates these slots with the goal of exploiting the AD entirely, and, therefore, all the bandwidth available. Otherwise, for applications with lower traffic rates, sender nodes can reserve unassigned slots on demand. This occurs, for instance, when there is an event that requires to be promptly notified at the base station (e.g., an alarm in a restricted area). This way, the sender requiring more slots transmits an Extension Request message (EREQ) to its intended receiver. Then, if the receiver has slots unassigned, it replies to the sender with an Extension Reply (EREP) message within the same transmission slot (the size of EREQ/EREP messages comprises a few bytes, so their transmission can be conducted successfully in a single slot), confirming the availability of slots to the sender. This implies that if the sender does not receive the EREP by its receiver, the sender assumes that there are no available slots.

The reception schedule in MULTI-HIT is intended to further alleviate secondary collisions due to hidden nodes, especially, in dense network deployments. As indicated, this type of collision occurs when two (or more) neighbor nodes, whose ADs are overlapped, select the same frequency channel to receive data. To deal with this issue, in MULTI-HIT, the ADs of one-hop neighbors are scheduled to begin at different time instants. Thereby, transmissions addressed to these nodes do not collide with each other. To achieve it, the entire WI of nodes is divided into a set of 
                              
                                 
                                    N
                                 
                                 
                                    
                                       AS
                                    
                                 
                              
                            slots which we denote as Active Slots (ASs). Each node has its own notion of WI, where the first AS is used to trigger the AD, while the remaining ASs comprise its ID. Besides, in this later period, the rest of one-hop neighbors are scheduled to execute their corresponding AD. In greater detail, every node randomly selects a (free) AS which is not in use by any of its one-hop neighbors. The selection order of ASs is determined by the network address assigned to each node (according to the IEEE 802.15.5 standard, network addresses are in the range 0–65534), giving preference to smaller addresses. In this sense, the node with the address numbered as 0 has the highest priority to select the AS. Upon the AS selection, it instructs its one-hop neighbors through the WN messages about the AS reserved. Thus, every one-hop neighbor will know beforehand when to transmit data to this node. In addition, once WN messages are received, one-hop neighbors accomplish their own AS selection. This procedure continues until the last node belonging to the WMSN obtains an AS.

As regards Eq. (1), the value of WI is proportional to the value of AD by a factor of

                            is the set of all network nodes. This expression is aimed at finding which one-hop neighbors of node

                            are also one-hop neighbors with each other. Eq. (31) is calculated for all network nodes, and the highest value determines the minimum duration of the WI.

                            does not include elements 4, 6, and 8). Besides, this value also informs node 5 that nodes 2, 4, 6 and 8 are nodes hidden to each other. Thereby, following with the design basis of the reception schedule, the first AS belonging to the WI of node 5 is used to run its AD, while the remaining AS is selected by its four one-hop neighbors. In any case, this minimum value obtained for the duration of the WI always represents a worst case, since it forces hidden nodes to select overlapped ASs, thus leading to secondary collisions which can only be resolved by the multi-channel operation of MULTI-HIT. Furthermore, for the topology of our example, this worst case also entails a duty cycle above 50%. This result yields a limited network lifetime (half of the node’s lifetime is spent in the active mode), not satisfying the requirements of long-term applications as the agriculture ones, where a complete agronomic cycle may be 6 months (see Section  4.5). For this reason, the user/decision maker may configure a WI for all nodes greater than the minimum one returned by Expression (31) in order to reduce the duty cycle and, therefore, increase the network lifetime. For instance, in Fig. 4
                           , we have established a WI composed of 8 ASs (that is, the WI is divided into 8 ADs), which means that the duty cycle is reduced to around 12.5%. Thus, according to Fig. 4 (same grid topology as the one shown in Fig. 3), node 5 uses the AS zero to trigger its AD, while its one-hop neighbors 2, 4, 6 and 8 receive data and transmit their WNs using ASs 1, 2, 4 and 8, respectively. Finally, note that the ASs 1–7 comprise the ID of node 5, which is used to save energy or to transmit data to any of its neighbors in its corresponding AS and frequency channel.

The pseudo code written in Table 3
                         describes the transmission procedure in MULTI-HIT. In particular, a sender node firstly computes and switches to the frequency channel in which the receiver wakes up in its following AD. Secondly, it calculates the time difference between the current time and the beginning of the receiver’s AS/AD. If the calculated value allows the sender node to switch to sleep state, then the sender enters this mode, waking up a short time before (in accordance with the GTD) the receiver begins the transmission of its WN. In the case that the time difference computed is not long enough for switching to sleep state, the sender remains in reception mode waiting for the WN message. Upon its reception, if the slot allocated to the sender is the following one to the slot reserved by the receiver to send its WN, the sender proceeds with the transmission of its data message. When the latter is not satisfied, the sender remains in sleep state until the beginning of its allocated slot, and then, sends its data message. Meanwhile, the receiver remains listening to the medium until the slots allocated to one-hop neighbors within its AD finalize. Finally, the sender switches to the sleep state upon reception of the ack frame from the receiver, while the receiver either switches to sleep state or takes the role of sender once its AD ends.

@&#PERFORMANCE EVALUATION@&#

This section presents the performance evaluation results obtained by computer simulation for the MULTI-HIT algorithm. We have selected different figures of merit such as the aggregate throughput, the message delivery ratio (both measured at the sink) and the network lifetime, which are usual in the assessment of WSN/WMSN scenarios  [51,52]. Furthermore, as an additional contribution of this section, we compare the behavior of MULTI-HIT proposal with three different approaches. Firstly, we contrast MULTI-HIT with the original ASES mode to corroborate how the HT phenomenon is clearly reduced. Secondly, we make a comparison with our analytical optimization model in order to confirm that both solutions offer similar results. Finally, MULTI-HIT and Queen-MAC proposals are also compared, illustrating how MULTI-HIT achieves better network performance under HT conditions than a solution validated by the scientific community.

To achieve these objectives, we have programmed our MULTI-HIT proposal in an ns-2 (Network Simulator 2) simulation environment. Ns-2 is a platform, widely accepted by the scientific community, which has been extensively used to verify a multiplicity of communication technologies, protocols and network scenarios. Regarding our evaluation, we start from Zheng development for the simulation of the IEEE 802.15.5 LR-WPAN mesh on ns-2  [53], which implements the main mandatory functions related to the mesh topology formation and routing  [2,34]. In particular, the routing protocol proposed in  [53] satisfies our design assumption regarding that each network node selects its nearest neighbor toward the destination/sink to forward data (Assumption (iii)). Thus, to conduct the simulation of the MULTI-HIT approach, we implemented all the necessary ns-2 functions in accordance with the features and considerations stated in Section  5. In addition, we have also programmed in our simulator the entire ASES operation in order to observe the performance improvement accomplished by our optimization model and the MULTI-HIT proposal. Finally, we implemented the Queen-MAC proposal in ns-2 as well, following the design rules pointed out in the work  [12].

The simulation experiments are conducted in a scenario composed of 100 sensor nodes distributed in a regular 10 × 10 grid topology. The remaining simulation parameters such as the distance between neighbors, traffic generation rate, message size and nodes’ power consumption, take the same values as the ones assigned in Section  4.5 (see Table 2). The goal is to carry out a fair comparison among the previous analytical study and the ASES, MULTI-HIT and Queen-MAC approaches. On the other hand, we disregard interference sources other than HT problems (e.g., noise, multi-path loss fading, etc.) in order to isolate, and, therefore, obtain a better quantification of the HT problems  [23], for which we use the free-space propagation model. Regarding MULTI-HIT, it can employ up to the 16 frequency channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band (this feature is supported by current radio transceivers, as the CC2420  [54] included in TelosB devices) to perform its multichannel functionality. As the synchronization issue concerns, MULTI-HIT assumes that nodes have a clock drift of 30 μs per second  [50], and the guard time duration is configured to 1 ms, which is an appropriate value to keep the synchronization accuracy  [40]. Finally, each simulation scenario is run 10 times with different random seeds and considering 95% confidence intervals.


                        Fig. 5
                         compares the results obtained by the simulation frameworks developed for MULTI-HIT and ASES mode. To this end, we have set different scenarios where all nodes select the same values of the Wakeup Order and Active Order parameters. We assume, as representative values of the WO parameter, those ranging from 6 to 10. Regarding the AO parameter, it must always be less than the WO, which implies dividing the WI into an AD plus an ID. Observing Fig. 5, we study the network performance as a function of the WO–AO parameters, distinguishing between two different cases. Firstly, the AO is fixed to 4 while the WO increases its value. The aim is to make the ID longer and, therefore, extend the network lifetime. Secondly, the AO takes the WO value minus 1, which allows us to divide the AD into several transmission slots to exploit the available bandwidth.

Regarding MULTI-HIT, results in Fig. 5(a) reveal that the aggregate throughput is mainly influenced by the value of the set WO–AO. In the case of AO  =  4 (AD is 80 ms), the greatest value of WO (WO  =  10) presents the lowest aggregate throughput. This is because high WO values imply a longer duration of the ID. In this case, nodes must wait for large periods between two consecutive ADs to dispatch their data which, in turn, decreases the total network throughput. On the other hand, for an AO=WO−1, MULTI-HIT results illustrate a significant improvement of the aggregate throughput regardless of the value of WO. The reason is that the AD is long enough to enable a large number of transmission slots. This feature together with the employment of multiple frequency channels allows MULTI-HIT to notably increase the utilization of the available bandwidth (up to 20 kbps of aggregate throughput for WO  =  10 and AO  =  9).


                           Fig. 5(b) illustrates the results for the network lifetime metric. In particular, the MULTI-HIT operation significantly extends the network lifetime in comparison with the ASES mode. The reason is because MULTI-HIT operation mitigates the HT phenomenon and allows the sender node to exactly know when its intended receiver begins its AD. Concerning the latter aspect, the sender under study can remain in sleep state until the receiver wakes up, thus saving energy. However, in the ASES mode, a sender must remain in active mode waiting for the reception of the WN from its intended receiver, which may cause the sender to consume a considerable amount of energy for every transmission attempt. In this sense, in the case that the AO is set to 4, MULTI-HIT extends the network lifetime to months (for 
                              6
                              ≤
                              
                                 WO
                              
                              <
                              10
                           ) or even years (almost 2 years for WO  =  10) with respect to the ASES mode, as the WO value increases. In addition, for the case of AO=WO−1, it can be observed how the results of network lifetime obtained by MULTI-HIT are always greater (approximately a month above) than the ones obtained for ASES mode.

The message delivery ratio is depicted in Fig. 5(c). In contrast to the poor performance of ASES, the results obtained by the simulation scenarios for MULTI-HIT are in the range of the 96% and 85% for the cases AO=4 and AO=WO−1, respectively. This deviation is mainly due to the number of Active Slots in which the WI can be divided into (see Section  5.2.3). In particular, in the case of AO=WO−1, the number of ASs calculated for all network nodes of the grid topology is always the same, its value being equal to two (see Eq. (31)). This means that the AS selected by nodes beyond one-hop neighbors which may act as hidden terminals coincides, what involves an increase in the number of collisions and messages lost. Under these circumstances, MULTI-HIT is able to alleviate this shortcoming by means of its transmission scheduling along with its multi-channel switching. Nevertheless, despite the MULTI-HIT operation, the message delivery ratio metric drops approximately a 10% with respect to the same scenarios implemented with an AO set to 4. The reason is, for the case of AO=4, the number of ASs increases as the WO value grows, which facilitates a better distribution of the ADs along the WI (an example of this issue was plotted in Fig. 4). This makes it more difficult for hidden nodes to trigger their own AD at the same time, resulting in a clear reduction of the number of collisions.

As can be noticed, Fig. 5 shows that MULTI-HIT obtains a better network performance than ASES mode regardless of the set WO–AO. ASES mode is unable to solve the HT problems which provoke many collisions and messages lost. This fact explains the sharp degradation of the different metrics depicted in Fig. 5, reducing, for instance, the number of messages received by the sink or increasing the energy cost to transmit a message successfully.

In this same figure, we also present the upper limit obtained from the optimization study. As can be seen, for the grid topology, the network lifetime and the aggregate throughput obtained by the simulation of MULTI-HIT is slightly less than the one resulting from the optimization analysis. This is mainly because the simulation includes the effect of different aspects such as retransmissions of data messages, the dispatching of ack frames, or the synchronization, as well as the propagation model, but they are disregarded in the optimization analysis. Nevertheless, numerical results are still very close to the simulation ones. This means that the multi-objective optimization study validates the MULTI-HIT algorithm proposed and vice versa.

Finally, to confirm the feasibility of our MULTI-HIT proposal, we compare its performance with the Queen-MAC scheme in Fig. 6
                        . In this case, we select the following two figures of merit: network lifetime and message delivery ratio. In order to carry out a fair comparison between both proposals, the duty-cycle scheme of each approach is set as a function of the activity and inactivity periods in which nodes execute their operations. On the one hand, we consider different WIs for MULTI-HIT ranging from 0.64 s to 20.48 s, which are obtained by substituting the WO values (from 7 to 12) in Eq. (1). To this respect, the Queen-MAC duty cycle consists of a slotted structure composed of 
                           n
                         slots of 100 ms each  [12]. Given that the rules for determining the duration of the duty cycle in Queen-MAC are different from MULTI-HIT, we adjust the 
                           n
                         value to obtain the nearest duration of the Queen-MAC duty cycle for each WI considered. As regards the activity period (ON), Queen-MAC reserves a minimum number of slots 
                           k
                         calculated as a function of 
                           n
                        , the traffic generation rate, the hop-distance to the sink, and the network dimension (parameter identifying the largest hop-distance on the network) for each node. Note that all the above parameters are fixed, excepting the 
                           n
                         value and the node’s hop-distance to the sink. The difference in the number of slots 
                           k
                         for each node depends exclusively on these parameters. Under these conditions, Queen-MAC assigns a larger number of 
                           k
                         slots to nodes located at the sink’s vicinity in order to dispatch all the traffic from the network to the sink. Thereby, nodes closer to the sink are the first ones to deplete their batteries, thus determining the network lifetime. Taking into account these considerations, the length of the AD in MULTI-HIT is approximated to the activity period of Queen-MAC with respect to the one-hop neighbors of the sink (by summing the 
                           k
                         slots computed for these nodes). Table 4
                         summarizes the configuration parameters referred to the duty cycle for both proposals.

Following with the comparative study between MULTI-HIT and Queen-MAC, Fig. 6(a) depicts the average results for the message delivery ratio metric. In this figure, we can observe how MULTI-HIT overcomes Queen-MAC in all scenarios proposed. Queen-MAC does not fully solve the HT problems, mainly due to the small number of frequency channels devoted to the multichannel procedure (fixed to 4 channels in accordance with  [12]) and the inefficient employment of the RTS/CTS handshaking mechanism. In particular, the RTS/CTS mechanism was designed to mitigate, a priori, the HT effects. However, in WMSN scenarios where communications are conducted in a multi-hop fashion, the RTS/CTS messages may also suffer from collisions when they are transmitted simultaneously by hidden terminals, thus restricting its functionality. Additionally, in Queen-MAC, the most remarkable outcomes for the message delivery ratio appear when the duration of the duty cycle is long enough. This is because for a small duty-cycle length, the one-hop neighbors of the sink remain in active mode dispatching data almost all the time (they require a greater number of 
                           k
                         slots than farther nodes), which increases the probability of collisions by hidden terminals. On the other hand, Fig. 6(b) shows how MULTI-HIT achieves better results (on average) than Queen-MAC for the network lifetime metric and for all the duty cycles considered, excepting the WI equal to 10.24 s. The reason lies in that the AD of MULTI-HIT is greater than the activity period configured by the Queen-MAC approach. In any case, the MULTI-HIT proposal extends the network operation more time than Queen-MAC, mostly due to two causes. Firstly, MULTI-HIT does not require sending RTS/CTS messages whenever a data transmission is performed, thus reducing the overhead. Secondly, MULTI-HIT employs a greater number of channels than Queen-MAC, which helps to reduce the amount of collisions by hidden terminals.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the Wireless Mesh Sensor Network arena, we presented two contributions aimed at facing the hidden terminal problem, a crucial concern that is closely related to the non-definitive penetration of this technology in the consumer market. On the one hand, we have designed a novel analytical model which shows a notable reduction in the number of collisions caused by hidden terminals without jeopardizing one of the main requirements of the WMSNs: energy efficiency. To achieve this purpose, firstly, we model our problem by means of multi-objective (MO) formulation, defining the minimization of the aggregate message collision time and the maximization of the network lifetime as objectives. Furthermore, our MO problem establishes important features of the IEEE 802.15.5 standard as constraints, in particular, its Asynchronous Energy Saving mode (ASES), and the hidden terminal phenomena, which allow us to approximate our mathematical formulation to the real operation of a WMSN. Secondly, the MO formulation is solved by the Goal Programming (GP) technique, which gives the best result for the set of objectives proposed. To this aim, we have preliminarly estimated the expected result for each objective (goal) from our experience in fields such as precision agriculture. These expected goals along with the problem constraints are extremely important because they allow GP to attain a real-world solution to our case of study. As our second contribution, we propose a MULti-channel TIme-scheduled algorithm for the HIdden Terminal problem avoidance (MULTI-HIT). In a WMSN scenario operating with ASES premises, MULTI-HIT is aimed at mitigating the hidden terminal phenomena thanks to the exploitation of the different frequency channels available in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and a straightforward coordination between any arbitrary sender–receiver pair.

To evaluate the appropriate behavior of our MULTI-HIT proposal, we developed a complete simulation framework, in order to fairly compare its results with our optimization study and a recent multi-channel time-slotted protocol called Queen-MAC which is also addressed to reducing the hidden terminal effects. Simulation experiments reveal that MULTI-HIT provides better results than the Queen-MAC approach, while a similar network performance is attained in comparison with our numerical solution, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of both approaches and their applicability to realistic scenarios.

As upcoming research, our analytical approach and MULTI-HIT proposal can be extended in order to include additional application-specific requirements typically encountered in real-world scenarios (e.g., environmental surveillance, automation and control (home and industrial), traffic monitoring, health service, among others). Following this line, to further improve the analytical model proposed, the inclusion of new constraints and/or objectives related to, for instance, the maximization of the network throughput in order to increase the data delivered at the sink node, will be addressed. Furthermore, we plan to extend our analytical model and MULTI-HIT to address the following issues. First, a channel interference model would be incorporated, which would help to measure more accurately the real interference experienced by nodes on a given frequency channel. Second, our twofold solution would be assessed for other network layouts (e.g., random topologies) and node densities. This would allow us to tackle the problem of messages collisions caused by other network issues, such as collisions due to CSMA-CA and intensive contention for the wireless medium. Finally, concerning MULTI-HIT proposal, we could also improve its performance as follows. On the one hand, nodes would periodically collect information referred to, for instance, the Receiver Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and/or the Link Quality Indicator (LQI), and using strategies such as machine-learning techniques  [55], each node would be able to determine whether a given channel is reliable enough to conduct the communications. On the other hand, additional information about the state of the nodes’ batteries and throughput per link would be added within WN messages, allowing sender nodes to balance their traffic load. This way, senders would avoid the transmission of messages to overloaded nodes, or whose available battery level is close to exhaust.
