                  The objective of the present paper is to develop a four-noded quadrilateral Cosserat point element (CPE) for the numerical solution of plane strain problems in finite elasticity of orthotropic materials with general orientation and initially distorted geometry. Generally speaking, the Cosserat point approach connects the kinetic quantities to derivatives of a strain energy function and once the strain energy of the CPE has been specified, the procedure needs no integration over the element region and it ensures that the response of the CPE is hyperelastic. In the present paper a functional form for the strain energy that controls the inhomogeneous deformations and allowing for accurate modeling of distorted meshes is proposed. A number of example problems, which compare the performance of the developed quadrilateral CPE with that of other elements based on the mixed formulation, reduced integration with enhanced hourglass control, and enhanced strains/incompatible modes methods, are considered. These examples demonstrate that CPE is free of hourglass instabilities, and it is a robust user friendly element that can be used for modeling finite deformations of orthotropic elastic materials.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Renewed interest in modeling structures made out of anisotropic materials was motivated by the need for modeling biological tissues, which are reinforced by bundles, and modeling fiber reinforced rubber that can be used in the tire industry. However, the finite element method can be used for modeling both isotropic and anisotropic structures. It is well known that the Bubnov–Galerkin approach exhibits locking for bending dominated response of thin structures with poor element aspect ratios, and for nearly incompressible materials. Therefore, various element technologies including methods of mixed variational principles [27], hybrid formulation [16], reduced integration with hourglass control [3,4,17,18], enhanced assumed strains [24–26,29,5,14], and mixed-enhanced strains [11,12] were developed to overcome these deficiencies. Although each of the latter approaches overcomes one or more of the above-mentioned unphysical behaviors, they may have a number of drawbacks. For instance, one of the drawbacks of the reduced integration method with hourglass control is the difficulty in determining stabilization parameters in the hourglass scheme, and their possible unphysical influence on the solution. The elements based on the enhanced strain technique can exhibit unphysical hourglassing in regions experiencing combined high compression with bending. Furthermore, it was shown in Jabareen and Rubin [7] that some of these improved element formulations in commercial codes can exhibit inelastic response, even though they attempt to model a hyperelastic material with a strain energy function.

Bearing in mind the deficiencies of the above-mentioned finite element technologies, the emerging need for modeling structures made out of anisotropic materials sets a challenge to the scientific and engineering communities. Recently, a novel finite element technology based on the theory of a Cosserat point [19–21] was developed and applied in the formulation of a 3-D brick element for the numerical solution of dynamic problems for nonlinear hyperelastic materials [15]. By way of background, the kinematics of the brick (CPE) are characterized by eight element director vectors and the kinetics propose eight balance laws of director momentum to determine the dynamic response of the element. A novel feature of the CPE is that the element is considered to be a structure with a response characterized by its strain energy. The nodal forces are related to derivatives of the strain energy function through algebraic relations in a similar manner to the relationship of the stress to derivatives of the strain energy function in the full three-dimensional theory of hyperelastic materials.

The objective of the present paper is to generalize the CPE formulation presented in Jabareen et al. [10] by making it capable for analyzing general elastic orthotropic materials under finite deformations with initially distorted meshes. In particular, in Jabareen et al. [10] the coefficients of the strain energy function, which controls the response to inhomogeneous deformations, were determined by limiting attention to a rectangular parallelepiped, and it was found that the formulation therein suffers from undesirable sensitivity to initially distorted meshes. Furthermore, it was shown by Jabareen and Rubin [8,9] that generalizing the CPE to accurately model general element shapes is an extreme challenge, and therefore, the development presented in the present paper is focused on the two-dimensional plane strain case. However, the resulting two-dimensional CPE should have a wider range of applications, such as within realistic two-dimensional engineering problems.

An outline of the present paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the theoretical background of the two-dimensional CPE. Section 3 describes the procedure for determining the constitutive coefficients in the strain energy function for the inhomogeneous deformations, and Section 4 discusses the formulation of the numerical solution of plane strain problems using the CPE. Section 5 presents a number of plain strain examples that demonstrate the response of the developed quadrilateral CPE and comparing it to different finite elements using the commercial finite package ABAQUS. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusions.

The CPE for a plane strain quadrilateral element is a continuum model which characterizes the response of a finite structure that occupies the region P, which is a right cylinder with a quadrilateral cross-section and unit thickness (see Fig. 1
                     ). Unless otherwise stated, all vectors and tensors are two-dimensional with components in the

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that within the context of the standard finite elements, with a fully integrated scheme (Bubnov–Galerkin approach), the pointwise deformation gradient

                         and its determinant are used to determine the stresses at the gauss points and the element internal nodal forces. Alternatively, in the Cosserat point approach the volume average deformation gradient

The weak equations of the balance of linear momentum are derived by following the standard Bubnov–Galerkin procedure, in which the strong form of the equation of balance of linear momentum (e.g. [6]) is multiplied by the shape functions N

                        , and then the result is integrated over the region P of the element. In particular, the weak equations of balance of linear momentum read

                        A simple three dimensional strain energy function for an orthotropic elastic material can be obtained by assuming that the strain energy function depends quadratically on the Lagrangian strain tensor. However, this simple three dimensional strain energy function exhibits unphysical deficiencies (e.g. zero cross-sectional area in extension, finite cross-sectional area at full compression, and stress softening in compression (see [10])), and therefore, it is not appropriate for modeling the finite deformation response of elastic orthotropic materials. Here, the strain energy

The developed quadrilateral CPE presented in the previous sections can be used to obtain the numerical solution of general two-dimensional plane strain structures made out of orthotropic material and undergo finite deformations. Similar to the standard finite element procedure, a given topology of a body is modeled as a collection of M elements, which interact through their common boundaries and are characterized by N global nodes located relative to a fixed origin. The kinematics and kinetics of the Ith (

The developed four noded quadrilateral orthotropic CPE with two translational degrees of freedom at each node was implemented into the commercial finite element package [1] through the user subroutine 
                        
                           UEL
                        
                     . Specifically, ABAQUS calls the 
                        
                           UEL
                        
                      subroutine with a guess for the nodal displacements of the element and the 
                        
                           UEL
                        
                      subroutine provides ABAQUS with the element residual vector (
                        
                           RHS
                        
                     ) as well as the element tangent stiffness matrix (
                        
                           AMATRX
                        
                     ) of the governing equations. Furthermore, the predictions of the developed Cosserat point element (CPE) were compared with three quadrilateral plane strain element formulations in ABAQUS. Predictions based on the selective reduced integration element (CPE4) are denoted by (AB1), those based on the incompatible modes element (CPE4I) are denoted by (AB2), and those based on the reduced integration (one integration point) element with enhanced hourglass control (CPE4R) are denoted by (AB3). Therefore, for ABAQUS׳s elements (i.e. CPE4, CPE4I, and CPE4R), the strain energy function (18) was implemented in ABAQUS using the user subroutine 
                        
                           UMAT
                        
                     . Specifically, in the 
                        
                           UMAT
                        
                      user subroutine, ABAQUS provides the subroutine with the deformation gradient, and the 
                        
                           UMAT
                        
                      then provides ABAQUS with the Cauchy stress tensor as well as with the spatial tangent moduli tensor consistent with the objective Jaumann–Zaremba stress rate.

In order to examine the accuracy and the robustness of the developed quadrilateral CPE formulation, a number of example problems are considered. For these examples, the material parameters of the strain energy function (18) are specified by

The patch test is considered as a fundamental test in finite element technology, and has been used for over five decades as a condition for convergence of finite elements as well as a verification tool for algorithms (see for example [28,2,30]). Different variants of the patch test have been suggested by different research studies. Two of them will be presented in this paper. To this end, a square with edge length L = 100.0mm that is meshed with five distorted elements is considered (see Fig. 3
                        a). The reference locations

Although Nadler and Rubin [15] showed that the CPE theory analytically satisfies a nonlinear form of the patch test, the objective of the following example is to demonstrate that the developed quadrilateral CPE formulation satisfies a nonlinear form of the patch test in a numerical manner.

This test is defined by applying external forces at the boundary nodes, which produce a constant stress state. An element technology passes this type of patch test when the predicted displacement fields are linear and coincide with the theoretical solution. In particular, the square described in Fig. 3a is subjected to external forces at nodes 2, 3 and 4, and boundary conditions are set so that a rigid body motion is eliminated as depicted in Fig. 3b.

                           . It can be seen that the predictions of the Cosserat point element CPE, the selective reduced integration element AB1, and the reduced integration element with enhanced hourglass control AB3 coincide with the theoretical solution for both tension and compression. The prediction of the incompatible mode element AB2 coincides with theoretical solution for tension, while it ceases to converge in compression. These results demonstrate that the CPE, AB1 and AB3 elements satisfy the force patch test, while the AB2 element does not satisfy this test.

This test is achieved by applying linear displacements field on the square׳s external nodes. An element technology passes this type of patch test when the displacements and stresses at the internal nodes correspond with the theoretical solution. In particular, the prescribed displacements at the exterior nodes are depicted in Fig. 3c and are specified by

                           Fig. 4b shows the errors predicted by the CPE, AB1, AB2 and AB3 elements for different values of applied uniaxial stretch. It can be seen that the predicted errors by the Cosserat point element CPE, the selective reduced integration element AB1 and the reduced integration element with enhanced hourglass control AB3 vanish for all the values of the applied stretch. However, the errors predicted by the incompatible modes element AB2 become nonzero in both tension and compression. Specifically, the solution predicted by the AB2 element exhibits instabilities in tension that lead to nonzero error, while in compression AB2 ceased to converge. These results demonstrate that the CPE, AB1 and AB3 elements satisfy the displacement patch test, while the AB2 does not satisfy this test.

The objective of this test is to check whether or not an element formulation of a hyperelastic material exhibits hyperelastic response [7]. In this regard, it should be noted that only a single calculation is needed to prove that an element formulation is not hyperelastic.

To this end, consider a single quadrilateral element which is a square in its reference configuration with edges of length L = 1m and fiber orientation angle

                         for the CPE should be zero, since the nodal forces in the CPE are determined by derivatives of a strain energy function. Therefore, the numerical values for the Cosserat solution in Table 2 represent the combined numerical error due to the convergence criterion used to satisfy equilibrium, machine precision and numerical integration of the work done using the trapezoidal rule. Furthermore, the results in Table 2 indicate that the element AB1 produces hyperelastic path-independent response, while the elements AB2 and AB3 exhibit inelastic response indicated by the nonzero values of

                         predicted by the element AB3 indicates that the element dissipates energy. Fig. 6
                         shows the residual element distortion after 10 deformation cycles of ABCDA predicted by the elements AB2 and AB3, which indicates that those elements predict hypoelastic response. It is emphasized that the displacements in Fig. 6 have not been enhanced.

The objective of this example is to examine the performance of the developed CPE for modeling thin structures with regular and irregular meshes and general orientation of the directions of the material orthotropy. Specifically, Fig. 7

                        . Specifically, Fig. 8a and b demonstrates that the CPE produces results similar to those of the AB2 for regular meshes, and in particular indicates that the CPE formulation is suitable for modeling thin structures with general orientation of material orthotropy.

                         and a coarse mesh with one element through the beam׳s thickness (n=1), Fig. 8c and d shows that the CPE is less accurate than AB2. However, the prediction of the CPE becomes close to the prediction of AB2 for a finer mesh with two elements through the beam׳s thickness (n=2), and the two elements predict the same error for meshes with 
                           n

                         predicted by the CPE, AB2 and AB3 for two meshes. Ideally, the response should be nearly insensitive to the value of mesh distortion. For the coarsest mesh with only one element through the beam׳s thickness, Fig. 9a shows that the error predicted by the CPE increases with increased distortion, with a maximum error of approximately 8% for the largest value of normalized irregularity (

                           5.0
                        ). However, by refining the mesh and having two elements through the beam׳s thickness (Fig. 9b), the errors predicted by the CPE are similar to those predicted by the AB2 element. It is interesting to note from Fig. 9a and b that the error predicted by AB2 for the largest value of normalized irregularity (

                           5.0
                        ) changes sign and even increases when the mesh is refined to have two elements through the beam׳s thickness. In contrast, the error predicted by the CPE decreases with mesh refinement, as expected. The element AB3 exhibits a similar sensitivity to mesh distortion like the CPE for coarse meshes, while the predicted errors by AB3 for regular meshes are larger than those predicted by the CPE.

The objective of this example is to examine the performance of the developed CPE for large deformations of a thin beam. Specifically, the cantilever beam with the dimensions specified in (51) is subjected to a uniform follower shear load

                        Fig. 11
                         shows the normalized shear load versus the normalized axial displacement of point A (see Fig. 7a) for two coarse meshes (n = 2, n = 4) and two elements 
                           CPE
                           ,

                           2
                        . Furthermore, the converged CPE solution denoted as CPE
                        ⁎ using the refined mesh (n=20) is also shown. It can be seen in Fig. 11a that for the mesh with n=2, the solutions obtained by both elements deviate from the converged solution for large values of applied shear load. This deviation can be attributed to the fact that the beam becomes curvy at large value of applied shear load (see Fig. 12
                        ), and as a result the mesh effectively becomes coarse. The solutions obtained by both elements for n=4 are closer to the converged solution as it can be seen from Fig. 11b. Furthermore, the solution based on AB2 ceased to converge for loads greater than the one associated with the point denoted by the symbol 
                           x
                         in Fig. 11. It should be emphasized that the load level at which the AB2 ceased to converge decreases with mesh refinement. This result indicates that the CPE is more robust than AB2 for modeling finite deformation of thin structures.

Finally, the deformed shape of the beam under the final load level is shown in Fig. 12.

The objective of this example is to examine the accuracy and the robustness of the developed CPE for large deformation of two dimensional problems. Specifically, Fig. 13
                         shows a sketch of a block that has length L

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the previous sections, a four-noded quadrilateral Cosserat point element (CPE) has been developed for large deformations of nonlinear orthotropic hyperelastic material with initially distorted geometry. The constitutive equations treat the CPE as a structure and the kinetic quantities are determined by hyperelastic equations as derivatives of the strain energy function. The constitutive coefficients in the inhomogeneous part of the strain energy function are determined analytically by comparing solutions of the CPE with the exact small deformation solutions for pure bending, and these coefficients are used for large deformations. The developed constitutive coefficients remove the undesirable sensitivity to initially distorted meshes with general orientation of orthotropy for two-dimensional structures.

A number of example problems have been considered to compare the response of the plane strain CPE with the response of different plane strain elements in the commercial finite element package ABAQUS. It was shown in the patch example that the CPE passed the nonlinear version of the patch test similar to the elements AB1 and AB3. However, the element AB2 failed to pass the nonlinear version of the patch test and exhibited unstable response even for homogenous deformations. In this regard it should be noted that all elements passed the small deformation patch test. By design the plane strain CPE produces hyperelastic response. In contrast, a test for path-independence has been considered which indicates that some of the other element formulations produced hypoelastic response even though they are based on a hyperelastic material with a strain energy function. In addition, the results of the small deformation of a shear loaded thin cantilever beam with initially distorted meshes and general orientation of the material orthotropy showed that the current developed CPE removed the undesirable sensitivity due to mesh distortion and/or general orientation of material orthotropy. Although the CPE is less accurate than AB2 for a very coarse mesh and a thin structure, the AB2 element ceased to converge for the follower force applied to a cantilever beam and for the indentation problem. In particular, it exhibited unphysical hourglassing for the indentation problem. In contrast, the CPE converged and predicted physical response for all of the example problems.
