                  This paper presents a new finite-element formulation for the dynamic analysis of three-dimensional beams. The formulation is based on the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam theory in which the strain vectors are the only unknown functions of the arc-length parameter. The classical Newmark time integration scheme extended to the multiplicative group of spatial rotations is used and properly adapted for the strain-based formulation. The Generalized-
                        α
                      method is used to enforce a numerical dissipation of higher modes. The update procedure needed in the iteration process is discussed in detail. The exact linearization of the governing equations is also presented. The performance of the formulation is demonstrated with numerical examples.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the present paper we consider the dynamic behaviour of the beam-like structures in the three-dimensional space. Geometry of the deformed three-dimensional beam is described by the axis of the beam and the cross-sections not necessarily normal to the axis at the deformed state. The configuration space of the beam thus consists of (i) the linear space of the position vector of the axis, and (ii) the non-linear space of rotations of cross-sections. Because the spatial rotations belong to the multiplicative SO(3) group, the configuration space of the beam is a non-linear manifold [1,2]. The non-linearity of spatial rotations considerably dictates both the choice of the finite element formulation of the beam and the time-integration technique.

The classical Newmark time integration scheme [3] is widely used in the time discretization of equations of motion in various beam finite-element formulations [4–6,2] and in structural dynamics in general. Yet it is only applicable for vector fields, and cannot be applied to the non-linear rotation fields with no modification. Furthermore, the Newmark time integration scheme is only conditionally stable in non-linear problems A sufficient condition to achieve unconditional stability is the energy decay argument [7–10]. This is why many algorithms have been invented which aim to automatically damp out high frequencies and thus improve the stability of the Newmark scheme. One such highly popular integration scheme is the Generalized-
                        α
                      method of Chung and Hulbert [11].

Since the pioneering works by Simo and his coworkers [2,12] emerged in eighties and early nineties, many innovative numerical formulations of spatial beams for the dynamic analysis have been proposed, see, e.g. Bottasso and Borri [13], Ibrahimbegović and al Mikdad [4], Jelenić and Crisfield [5], Romero and Armero [14], Mata et al. [15], to list just a few. The choice of displacements and rotations as primary variables in the spatial and time discretization is a common feature of the above cited works. Although the displacements and the rotations appear to be the best choice for the primary variables from the implementation perspective, other aspects like accuracy, stability and robustness count more. An important drawback of the displacement-based formulations is locking. Another weakness of the displacement–rotation based formulations, which also concerns the accuracy of the formulation, is the assumption of the independent interpolations for displacements and rotations, which is in a sharp contrast with the theoretically proven linked interpolation of these mutually dependent quantities [16].

Zupan and Saje [17,18] show that the strain-based beam formulation for the static analysis completely avoids the above listed weaknesses by choosing the strain measures as the only spatially interpolated variables. In contrast to the displacements and rotations, which are mutually dependent by the theoretical argument, the translational and rotational strain measures are independent; moreover, they are additive quantities. Hence any additive interpolation of strains is automatically kinematically consistent, and, after integrated, gives fully consistent displacement and rotation fields. This increases the accuracy, stability and robustness of such an approach. A further advantage of the strain-based beam elements is their direct applicability and suitability for the use of wavelet shape functions [19] in the interpolation.

The fundamental problem of any strain-based formulation is the integration of rotations from the interpolated rotational strains. In three dimensions, the derivative of the rotational vector with respect to an arc-length parameter equals the product of the rotation-dependent transformation matrix and the rotational strain. Such a system of three differential equations cannot be integrated in a closed form. That is why, in the three-dimensional beam theories, the rotational strain is very rarely chosen as the primary variable. Such formulations, yet only for the linear Timoshenko beam theory, were proposed by Choi and Lim [20] and Friedman and Kosmatka [21], who used a constant interpolation for curvature. Schulz and Filippou [22] interpolated both the infinitesimal (incremental) curvatures and the infinitesimal rotations.

The present formulation does a step further and employs the exact non-linear relationship between the rotational strains and the rotations and assumes a polynomial interpolation of the curvature vector of any order. Due to an analytically non-integrable form of the rotation–strain relation, the numerical integration is used in order to obtain the total rotations from the given curvatures. This way a novel space and time discretization for the three-dimensional dynamic analysis of the beam is obtained, in which the strain measures are the only spatially interpolated variables. The time discretization combines the Newmark scheme and the Generalized-
                        α
                      method, properly adopted to strains as the new primary unknowns. The spatial discretization is carried out by the collocation method. Such a collocation-strain-based formulation completely avoids the differentiation of the shape functions, which increases the accuracy of the stress-resultants in space and time.

In the geometrically exact finite-strain beam theory, the configuration of the three-dimensional beam at an arbitrary time t is described by (see Fig. 1

                      rather than from the equilibrium equations (10) and (11) are called the constitutive force and moment. The equilibrium and the constitutive stress-resultants should theoretically be equal; however, this is not automatically true in the numerical solution of the discretized problem. In order to avoid such an inconsistency of the numerical solution, we follow the concept introduced by Vratanar and Saje [25] and explicitly demand the equality of the two kinds of stress-resultants

Once the integrals in (29)–(34) are resolved, Eqs. (19)–(22) become satisfied. Hence the remaining governing equations of the strain-based formulation for the dynamic analysis of the geometrically exact three-dimensional beam now consists only of yet unsatisfied equations, i.e. the constitutive equations (17) and (18), the kinematic boundary conditions (33) and (34), the static boundary conditions (23) and (24), and the initial conditions (27) and (28). The system consists of eight vector equations for eight unknown vector quantities: (i) the kinematic vectors

                     These equations should be supplemented with the auxiliary relations (29)–(32), and the initial conditions (27) and (28). Due to its strong non-linearity, the system is solved numerically.

The initial value problem given by (35)–(42) and (27) and (28) is here solved in time by the Newmark time integration scheme. The present approach follows and extends to dynamics the ideas from the static formulation by Zupan and Saje [17].

The application of time integrators to three-dimensional beam dynamics is not a straight-forward task. The reason is the multiplicative nature of spatial rotations. Simo and Vu-Quoc [2] were the first to present the extension of classical Newmark's algorithm for the use in the SO(3) group. We will here adapt their extension to the present strain-based formulation. This is not a routine procedure, however, and a special care must be taken to express properly the increments of the kinematic quantities with the incremental strains being the primary quantities of the iteration process in the present formulation.

We solve the non-linear system of Eqs. (63) and (64), (51)–(56) by the iterative Newton method, which requires the linearization of discrete equations about the current deformed configuration. Let us assume that all the quantities at the current iteration step i of the configuration at time

                        . In order to employ the Newmark time integration scheme in the strain-based formulation, we have to express the iterative updates of the kinematic and dynamic quantities with the iterative variations of the primary unknowns.

From the non-linearity of the three-dimensional rotations follows that the variations of the rotational quantities are not necessarily equal to their updates. In order to satisfy the kinematic boundary conditions, iterative updates of rotational vectors are taken to coincide with their variations, while the rotational strain vector updates need to be obtained with respect to the exact (non-varied) kinematic equations. From the kinematic equation (6) it follows:

Note that the displacements, stress-resultants and translational strains are additive quantities so that their updates are equal to their variations and thus can simply be added to the current values. The updates of the rotational vectors are performed in accordance with the multiplicative nature of rotations. The update procedure of the primary variables is summarized in Table 1

                        Eq. (88) defines the kinematically admissible variation of the rotation matrix which is consistent with its multiplicative update. It is useful to observe that the variation of the rotation matrix applied to an arbitrary vector 
                           u
                         can be written in several forms

                        As already observed, the updates of angular velocities and accelerations in (74) and (75) are additive. Similarly, it is possible to introduce an additive rotational vector [1]. It is well known that such an additive variation of the rotational vector, denoted by

                           ϕ

The linearization of the stress-resultant forces and moments is performed in accordance with their decomposition (47) and (48). The details are presented in Appendix A, so that only the results are summarized here. Based on the expressions (81), (82), (86), (89), (95) and (96), the linearizations of the components of the stress-resultants at time

We present several numerical examples to assess the validity and performance of the present formulation. In the first examples we consider a simple structure with existing analytical solution. Next, we consider the dynamic behaviour of several highly flexible beam-like structures undergoing large displacements and rotations. We show that the proposed formulation is fully capable of reproducing the results of other formulations. With the last example we show the true strength of the proposed formulation when material non-linearity is considered. We highlight the importance of the consistency conditions being satisfied, which is the unique property of proposed formulation.

The strain-objectivity, path independence and insensibility to shear locking are inherited from the static approach and therefore not discussed here. For these important issues the reader is referred to the papers [17,18]. The convergence of the discretized constant-strain-based solution with the increasing number of elements to the exact nonlinear solution was also proved, see [28]. A linear elastic material is employed in a first set of examples for which the relationships between the constitutive forces and strains are defined by

For the evaluation of integrals in the tangent matrix and in the residual vector, the classical Gaussian numerical integration is used, where an integral is replaced by a weighted sum. To optimize the computations and to enhance the accuracy of the numerical integration, we make the collocation points and the interpolation points to be coincident with the integration points. For the integration over the whole length of the element, the Gaussian quadrature is implemented. Local integrals between the two integration points are needed in the evaluation of nested integrals. A combination of the recursive trapezoidal rule and the Gaussian integration is used for the evaluation of these local integrals. See Appendix B for more details.

In order to assess the performance of the present implementation of the Generalized-
                           α
                         scheme we consider highly stiff pendulum shown in Fig. 2
                        . The so-called Simple Pendulum problem was studied by many authors, among which, Kuhl and Crisfield [10] used it to demonstrate the performance of various time integration schemes, including Generalized-
                           α
                         method.

The circular motion of the pendulum is initiated by tangential velocity

                         shows the total energy of the pendulum on the time interval [0,30] and confirms the findings presented in [10, Fig. 6]. For every time step the analysis with the Newmark scheme eventually becomes unstable which results in oscillations and growth of the total energy. It is also confirmed that the use of the Generalized-
                           α
                         scheme itself does not assure the stability of the time integration. For the given time step, the time integration parameters must be carefully chosen to obtain stable integration with energy dissipation. However, the use of the numerical dissipation can greatly affect the accuracy of the results. Figs. 4 and 5

                        , in comparison with the exact solutions for rigid pendulum. We can conclude that the use of larger time steps together with numerical dissipation could lead to inaccurate results. The accuracy of results is improved by using smaller time steps.

This example was first presented by Ibrahimbegović and al Mikdad [4]. A straight beam is initially placed in the XY plane (Fig. 6
                        ). The support at one end of the beam allows the translation in the Z-direction and the rotation about the Z-direction. Force

The model of the beam consists of 10 linear finite elements with the linear variation of strains. We observe the motion of the beam from t=0 to t=50. We ran the simulation using the Newmark scheme with the time step taken the same as in [4]: 
                           Δ
                           t
                           =
                           0.5
                        . The free-end displacements of the beam are compared with the results by Ibrahimbegović and al Mikdad [4] in Fig. 7
                        . The present displacements in the X and Y directions are in very good agreement with those presented in [4].

The total energy for this problem is presented in Fig. 8
                         for longer time interval [0,100]. We can observe that for long-term calculations with relatively long time steps a growth of energy might be expected when using the Newmark method. For finer meshes such instability occurs later. The use of the Generalized-
                           α
                         scheme for this problem results in a stable behaviour of the total energy.

We study the right-angle cantilever first presented by Simo and Vu-Quoc [2]. The cantilever shown in Fig. 9
                         is initially at rest in the XZ-plane. An out-of-plane point load

                         presents the displacements in the out-of-plane direction Y of the elbow and the free-end, for the time interval 
                           t
                           ∈
                           [

                           ]
                        . Two finite-element meshes with 4 (two per each beam) and 20 (10 per each beam) straight elements with the quadratic interpolation of strains were considered. The Newmark scheme was used and a constant time step 
                           Δ
                           t
                           =
                           0.25
                        , as in [2], was kept throughout the entire calculation. The results for both meshes were essentially the same. From Fig. 10 we can conclude that the present results well reproduce the results of Simo and Vu-Quoc [2].

The total energy increases rapidly while the external forces are applied, see Fig. 11
                        . After the external forces are removed from the system, the energy remains almost constant for smaller time step 
                           Δ
                           t
                           =
                           0.1
                        . For larger time steps the total mechanical energy oscillates about the constant value. These oscillations result in the loss of stability for long-term calculations.

This classical example of Simo and Vu-Quoc [2] involves extremely large displacements. A straight beam of length L=10 is initially placed in the XZ-plane in an inclined position. The initial coordinates of the end points of the centroidal axis are (6,0,0) and (0,0,8) (Fig. 12
                        ). A concentrated force

Roughly at t=16 the analysis starts suffering a rapid growth of the mechanical energy, leading to the loss of convergence of the Newton method. Simo et al. [12] experienced a similar behaviour. The growth of the mechanical energy in the present analysis is mainly due to the high frequency oscillations of the stress-resultants. In order to obtain a stable solution, we employed the Generalized-
                           α
                         scheme. We study the influence of the value of the spectral radius

                         report the results for the displacements of the loaded end of the beam and the mechanical energy of the beam, respectively. We can observe that the spectral radius influences the dissipation of the energy during the early stages of motion when the high frequency noise occurs. Thereafter the decay of the total mechanical energy of the beam remains small. The decay of the energy is smaller if a shorter time step is used. The two observed parameters, particularly the size of the time step, have a substantial influence on the displacements of the beam.

The swing composed from a flexible horizontal beam with a concentrated mass attached, and rigid links (Fig. 17
                        ) was originally analysed by Bauchau and Theron [7] and later on by Ibrahimbegović and Mamouri [8,9]. A mass m=0.5 is rigidly connected to the horizontal flexible beam. The material and geometric properties of the beam are

The high rigidity of the links is modelled by setting their Young's modulus 100-times the value of the modulus of the beam. The mass of the rigid links is neglected and the-cross section of the links is taken to be the same as the cross section of the flexible beam. The hinges connecting the rigid links with the horizontal beam allow for free rotation about the Y-axis. The swing is put into a planar motion by a point force

                        , applied at the midspan of the flexible beam. The force is acting as a triangular pulse over the period [0,0.256] with the peak

                           2
                         at t=0.128. The finite-element mesh of the structure consists of 40 six-node elements, of which 4 elements are used to model the rigid links and 32 elements the flexible beam.

                         by the sequence of the deformed shapes depicted in

                         time intervals, until t=1. Smooth motion of the system is interrupted when the rigid link on the right-hand side reverses the direction of motion. The event occurs at t=0.641 and results in a highly oscillatory response of the flexible beam. The displacements of the observation point B on the beam are shown in Fig. 19
                         and agree well with the results presented in [7–9].

The two analyses give essentially the same results for the displacements. The time histories of the mechanical energy for the two analyses are presented in Fig. 20
                        , where the time history of the energy for the analysis with the energy conserving/decaying scheme, presented in [9], is also shown. We can observe a sudden loss of energy at the time of the critical event which triggers high frequency oscillations. After the high frequencies are damped out, the rate of decay of the energy remains small until the end of the simulation. As expected, the decay of the mechanical energy is smaller for the analysis with the time step

To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our model in the presence of non-linear algebraic constraints, we study the four-bar mechanism problem proposed by Bauchau [29] among a set of benchmark test for flexible beam dynamics. The mechanism depicted in Fig. 21
                         consists of three bars initially lying in the XY-plane connected to each other by revolute joints and supported at points A and B. Both supports allow only the rotation about the Z-direction. The axes of rotation of the revolute joints at points A, B and D are normal to the plane of the mechanism. In order to simulate the initial imperfection of the system, the axis of rotation of the revolute joint at point C is inclined with respect to the normal axis. The angle between the axis of the joint C and the normal axis is taken to be 
                           φ
                           =
                           5
                           °
                        . A constant angular velocity 
                           
                              
                                 ω
                              
                              
                                 A
                              
                           
                         is applied at point A. The initial inclination of the joint results in three-dimensional response of the system with large internal forces.

In modelling of revolute joints we follow [30] and introduce the kinematic constraints, which are enforced to the system of governing equations by Lagrange multiplier method.

The geometric and material properties of the mechanism are taken from [29] and are as follows:

                        , until t=12. As in [29] we selected the parameters of the Generalized-
                           α
                         scheme according to the spectral radius at infinite frequency

                         and are in perfect agreement with the reference ones [29]. Despite large displacements, rotations and internal forces of the system, we were able to produce accurate results using only one finite element with cubic interpolation of strains for each bar. The analyses with the values of spectral radius at infinite frequency between 0 and 0.9 were also carried out and gave almost identical results as for

The present finite-element formulation imposes the consistent equilibrium at the predefined number of the cross-sections of the beam. To demonstrate the importance of satisfying the equality of the equilibrium and constitutive stress-resultants, we study Foure's concrete column [31] and compare the numerical results of the present consistent formulation with the formulation where the consistency conditions (17) and (18) are satisfied only in their weak form.

The reinforced concrete column (Fig. 23
                        ) tested by Fouré was clamped at one end and subjected to an eccentric axial point load 
                           F
                         at the free end. The load was rapidly increased until the failure of the column. We model the reinforced concrete using the bilinear constitutive law of reinforcing steel and the stress–strain law for concrete proposed by Desayi and Krishnan [32]:

The load deflection curve of the top of the column is shown in Fig. 24
                        . The results of our simulation are close to the experimental values and the results of Kanstad [33]. We can observe only a small difference between the results computed with the consistent formulation and those computed with the weak formulation of consistency conditions.

We now focus on the results for the stress-resultants. Figs. 25 and 26
                        
                         show the difference of the constitutive and the equilibrium axial force and bending moment for the two load levels: (a) F=100kN where the concrete is still in the elastic zone, and (b) F=460kN where the concrete is close to failure. We can observe that the effect of the inconsistency of the stress resultants is negligible if material behaves elastically. On the other hand, differences between the equilibrium and constitutive stress resultants can be observed if material becomes nonlinear.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We presented a new finite-element formulation for the dynamic analysis of the geometrically exact spatial beam theory, based on the interpolation of strain vectors. The essential points of this strain-based formulation are as follows:
                        
                           (i)
                           The strain-based formulation employs strain vectors as the only functions that need to be interpolated. As it has been proved in our previous work on the static analysis [17,18], such a formulation is strain-objective, path independent, locking-free and has advantages in describing materially non-linear problems.

The present paper shows how to extend the strain-based statics formulation to dynamics. Two different time integrators are implemented: the classical Newmark scheme and the Generalized-
                                 α
                               scheme.

Apart from the strain interpolation issue, a further distinctive characteristic of the present finite-element formulation is the satisfaction of the consistency condition that the equilibrium and the constitutive internal force and moment vectors are equal at the given set of points (the ‘collocation’-type of the consistency). As the determination of the internal force and moment vectors in the strain-based formulation requires no differentiation, the accuracy of the internal force and moment vectors is of the same order as the accuracy of the basic variables (strains). As demonstrated, this is of utmost importance in materially non-linear problems.

Both time-integration schemes studied here are implicit and hence require the linearization of the discretized governing equations to be done in each iteration. The linearizations are not trivial however. The exact analytical linearizations are derived and consistent update procedures needed in each Newton iteration step are discussed in the context of the strain-based finite element beam dynamics for the first time.

Several numerical problems were presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model. The limitations of the employed time-integration schemes were also shown and discussed. With numerical dissipation using Generalized-
                                 α
                               method stable time integration can be reached, but not for any choice of parameters.
