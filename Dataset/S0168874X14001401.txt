                  In this paper, an adaptive refinement procedure in conjunction with the B-spline finite element method is presented for the effective and efficient analysis of Euler–Bernoulli beam and planar elasticity problems. The B-spline plays a key role in the construction of stable wavelet on the interval, and there is actually no limitation for the interval. The spline elements are constructed in practical domain in this paper, and the spline bases concerns nodes distributed on the interval. As a result, the B-spline finite element method can be reconsidered as a meshless method. By repositioning the nodes of the spline bases, the accuracy of the method can be improved, and a simple node moving strategy is proposed to displace the nodal points to the areas indicated by the higher values of the error indicator. The efficiency and effectiveness of proposed B-spline finite element method and adaptive refinement technique are tested on some benchmark examples with the available analytical solutions and the results are presented.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Wavelet transform is originally developed from window Fourier transform [1], since then it has become a powerful tool for signal and image processing [2,3]. The wavelet is also found to be useful in mathematical analysis because of its advantage such as completeness, orthogonality and multiresolution (MRA) [4–10]. The construction of wavelet on the interval extended the usage of wavelet in solving PDEs [11–15]. It is a key problem to choose the approximate spaces for finite element method (FEM). Due to its desirable advantages, researchers are now paying attention to the adoption of wavelet in FEM and satisfied results have been obtained [16–21].

One key property of wavelet is MRA. However, in some FEM based on wavelet, only scaling functions is used as shape function, which means that the MRA of wavelet is ignored. In a multiresolution finite element method [16] both scaling functions and wavelets are used. The finite element equation is scale-decoupled across scales, and the accuracy can be improved by adding details in the detail spaces. Since the degree of freedom (DOF) of higher level detail space is double that of lower level detail space, the DOF increase exponentially with level, which is actually ineffective for numerical analysis. On the other hand, the FEM using only scaling functions can improve accuracy by adding more elements as the traditional FEM.

Unlike other wavelets, B-spline wavelets have explicit expressions, which make the numerical calculation convenient [17,22]. To overcome the instability phenomenon when using the original spline wavelets as interpolating functions [23], the authors of [11,13,15] have proposed different ways to construct spline wavelets on the interval. The construction in [11] was the first construction of biorthogonal spline wavelet bases on the interval, that fulfilled many important properties such as polynomial exactness, multiresolution, and Riesz bases. The scaling functions constructed are obtained by cutting off from the original B-spline, and the wavelets are computed with aid of the method of stable completion. While in [15] which is based on the semi-orthogonal Chui–Wang spline-wavelets, the Schoenberg spline bases on the interval concerning equidistant nodes in the interior of the interval and multiple nodes at the endpoints are chosen for the construction of the primal MRA. Through combining the ideas of these two papers, the author of [13] constructs biorthogonal spline wavelet bases on the interval with better Riesz bounds. All these wavelet bases are constructed on the interval [0, 1]. The application of the B-spline wavelets bases to the versatile finite element method is based on the fact that the wavelet bases on [0, 1] have limited dimension and they form Riesz bases for L
                     2([0, 1]). The traditional FEM, however, encounters some difficulties when dealing with problems involving moving boundaries, crack propagation or extremely large deformation due to their need for remeshing of the domain. Since the Schoenberg spline bases on the interval can actually be constructed on any bounded interval, the element can be constructed in the practical domain. In this way the B-spline finite element method can be seen as a meshless method, which makes the remeshing procedure easier.

There are two purposes in this paper. Firstly, it provides a new perspective to the B-spline finite element method. Secondly, a simple and efficient adaptive refinement strategy is proposed, which can also be applied to other meshless methods. The layout of this paper is as follows: Section 2 provides a brief description of the B-spline functions in the interval which are shape functions in this work; Section 3 introduces the transformation matrix which is used to enforce the boundary conditions; Section 4 describes how to construct Euler–Bernoulli beam and plane elastomechanics elements; the posteriori error estimator based on residual and adaptive refinement procedure is described in Section 5. Section 6 illustrates the capabilities of the method through some numerical examples, which either been analyzed by other researchers or with known analytical solutions. Finally some conclusion remarks are presented in Section 7.

B-spline functions for a given simple node sequence can be constructed by taking piecewise polynomials between the nodes and joining them together at the nodes in such a way as to obtain a certain order of overall smoothness.

One of the key features of FEM is to enforce an essential boundary condition. It is simple for the traditional FEM because the interpolants possess Kronecker delta property. However when taken the splines as interpolants, the coefficients of the interpolant are not the same as the nodal values, that is for

In order to introduce the boundary conditions, the stiffness or mass matrix (for dynamic analysis) should be transformed from B-spline space into physical space, and the corresponding element degree of freedoms (DOF) from the coefficients into unknown field function. For the one-dimensional case we assume that the unknown field u can be approximated by spline functions as

The beam element we construct is based on the Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. The basic assumption is that a normal to the midsurface of the beam remains straight during deformation and its angular rotation is equal to the slope of the beam midsurface. The static governing equation of the Euler–Bernoulli beam model is written as follows:

Adaptivity is an important tool for improving the efficiency of numerical methods. Any adaptive procedure is composed of two main steps i.e. error estimation and mesh refinement. For any successful adaptive procedure, a reliable error estimator is essential. The methods to estimate the error generally fall into two broad categories namely the residual based methods and the recovery based methods. In the first method the residual of the differential equation or some function of the residual is used as a measure of the error. The second approach uses the error in the gradient of the solution as a measure of the error. A comprehensive survey of the existing error estimators can be found elsewhere [24].

Since the error is used for the mesh refinement, in this study rather than the exact error we care more about the error distribution on the problem domain. An error estimator based on residual is adopted. Consider the following general partial differential equation governing a general elasticity problem:

Once the distribution of error is available, one can use the refinement techniques to adapt the numerical approximation such that an improved solution is obtained by resolution the problem. H-refinement is one of the mostly used refinement approaches in mesh based numerical method such as finite element and finite volume methods, in which the grid spacing is adapted locally or globally in such a way to increase local and global accuracy by introducing more points on the areas of high errors [24].

There are three distinct ways to carry out the H-refinement method. In the first method referred to as mesh moving method, the number of nodes is kept fixed and they are relocated according to error distribution over the domain. The advantage of this method is that it does not lead an increase in the computational effort required to resolve the problem. However, the method can face some difficulty when used with mesh based methods due to mesh distortion. In mesh enrichment the original nodes are also kept fixed and additional nodes are added in the areas suggested by the predicted error distribution. This method may also face mesh distortion problem. The third method is referred to as remeshing approach, in which a completely new mesh is created from the error calculated from the solution obtained on the previous mesh.

Many different mesh moving algorithms have been proposed for various problems. Amongst the existing algorithms, the spring analogy method is one of the most used. This method is applicable to both structured and unstructured meshes and, therefore is suitable to be used with meshless methods. The method is also favored because of its simplicity, flexibility, and less memory requirements. However, one problem of mesh moving algorithms for the spring analogy method as proposed in [25] is that when the error in an area is quite small, the nodes distributed around a much bigger area are nearly none, especially for one dimension. 
                     Fig. 3(a) shows an error distribution, and Fig. 3(b) shows the uniform nodal distribution and nodes refined by spring analogy model. As can be seen, although the nodes refined by spring analogy model concentrate around x=350 near where the biggest error occurs, it is not a good nodal distribution for the computation. To overcome this problem we propose a direct algorithm based on the error distribution. The error distribution can be seen as probability density distribution of the refined nodes in the domain and the algorithm is named probability model. This idea is in accord with the fact that the accuracy can be improved by introducing more points on the areas of high errors. The refined nodes can be obtained in two different ways. In the first way the domain is divided into many small equal areas and the number of nodes in each area is equal to the total number multiplied by the probability. In the second way the refined nodes itself are seen as the division of the domain, and each area has equal probability. As a result, the larger the probability density is, the smaller the size of the area is. Since two-dimensional B-spline basis functions can be constructed by tensor product, we only propose moving algorithms for one-dimension in this paper. In 
                     Fig. 4(a), the curve of the error is divided by the refined nodes and the area of each segment which can be regarded as probability is equal. The nodes below marked by squares are uniform distributed. Compared with the nodes refined by spring analogy model in Fig. 3(b), the nodal distribution is apparently better for computation. Fig. 4(b) shows the nodes in two-dimension for B-spline basis functions constructed by tensor product.

In this section the Euler–Bernoulli beam and two 2-D plane elasticity benchmark examples are solved using the proposed adaptive B-spline based FEM and the results are presented and compared with the analytical solutions. The plane elasticity examples include (1) a square isoperimetric plane sheet subjected to a consistent load and (2) a cantilever beam under end load.

In this example, we consider, in particular, the case of non-uniform Euler–Bernoulli beams with flexural stiffness presenting singularity according to the following form:

The process begins with the simulation of the problem on uniform nodal distribution which are used to construct the spline. Fig. 5 represents the exact error and the error distribution calculated by residual (23). As can be seen, the error around x
                        0=300 is the largest, and the exact error is approximated by the residual to a large extent. Then the nodes are refined according to the error distribution and an adaptive B-spline is constructed. The problem is now resolved based on the new B-spline and the results are compared. 
                        Fig. 6 is the error of the result calculated on the initial uniform nodes, the nodes refined by residual (RbR) and the nodes refined by exact error (RbE), respectively. They are all with 11 nodes. As can be seen, the error has been reduced dramatically by refinement. The refined nodes is also plotted on the curve, there tend to be more nodes around x
                        0=300 where the largest error occurs.

In 
                        Fig. 7(a) and (b) the error of the results with different number of nodes is compared. The improvements achieved by the proposed adaptive refinement procedure are evident from the results. It shows that the result based on the nodes refined by exact error is more accuracy than that of the nodes refined by residual. This is because the residual cannot represent the error exactly.


                        
                        Fig. 8 shows the convergence curves of the results calculated based on the initial uniform nodes and the nodes refined by residual. As can be seen, the convergence rate of the result based on the initial uniform nodes is bigger, however this may be because that the error of the result based on the nodes refined by residual has been reduced dramatically.

As shown in 
                        Fig. 9, the consistent loads q=1×105, material parameters and, geometric parameters t=1 and L=1.

As described above, tensor product B-spline bases are used as shape functions in two-dimensional problems. The layout of nodes is also in the form of tensor product, i.e. m×n, once again the problem is solved based on the initial uniform nodal distribution. 
                        Fig. 10 is the plane sheet displacement solved on 121 uniform nodes, which is agreement with [17]. The error distributions are estimated using the residual. The error along x direction is summed and the nodes are refined only in y direction. Finally the node moving process is implemented and the refined nodal distributions are obtained, which are shown in 
                        Fig. 11. The results of the problem obtained numerically based on the refined nodal distribution are compared with that of the initial uniform distribution. They are also compared with that of the traditional FEM SHELL41 [17].


                        
                        Fig. 12 is the convergence of results of calculated based on the uniform nodal (UN) distribution and the nodes refined by residual (RbR). We can see that the convergence speed and the accuracy of the results are improved slightly based on the refined nodes.


                        
                        Fig. 13 shows the convergence curves of the B-spline finite element method based on refined nodes (RbR) and the SHELL41 element method. The data of the SHELL41 element method is taken from [17]. As can be seen, the curve of the B-spline finite element method becomes rather flat when there are more than 400 nodes. In this view the B-spline finite element method based on refined nodes converges faster. It is worth noting that the result of the B-spline finite element method on 100 nodes and the result of the SHELL41 element method on 900 elements get nearly the same accuracy.

The comparison of B-spline FEM results with 100, 400, 900 and 1600 SHELL41 elements solutions along middle line are shown in 
                        Fig. 14. Note that the displacement on the 11 points of 121 RbR and 3721 UN is obtained by interpolation. As can be seen, the accuracy of 121 UN and 121 RbR is between 900 SHELL41 and 1600 SHELL41, and the error of 121 RbR is on both sides of the zero line.

As a third example, the problem of a cantilever beam subjected to a lump load at the end shown in 
                        Fig. 15 is considered, the exact solution of which is given by Timoshenko and Goodier [27]

                        3/3 is considered for a beam with rectangular cross-section and unit thickness. The problem is solved using the B-spline finite element method under plane stress condition with the following constants: P=1, E=1000, c=1, L=12, and ν=0.3.

The problem is solved on uniform nodal distribution and refined nodes respectively. In 
                        Fig. 16 the results of UN (a) and RbR (b) are compared to the analytical results respectively. As can be seen, both the displacement results are in good agreement with closed-form solutions. The error of vertical displacement v along lower surface of the beam is shown in

                         over the cantilever beam is plotted in 
                        Fig. 18. In both Figs. 17 and 18 it is seen that the accuracy is improved by refining the nodal distribution. Finally, 
                        Fig. 19 shows the convergence curves of the B-spline finite element method on the uniform and refined nodes indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The L-shape domain problem in plane stress condition is shown in 
                        Fig. 20, which is proposed by Zienkiewicz [28] as a case for the ability of elements to calculate the corner stress. It is also solved by wavelet element method in [18]. In this example, Young׳s modulus E=1500/15, Poisson rate ν=0.25, length L=10. Three two-dimensional B-spline elements are adopted as indicated in the figure. The problem is solved based on uniform nodes and refined nodes respectively. The total number of nodes for the domain can be seen as 14×14. The displacement of nodes is shown in 
                        Fig. 21. The stress σ
                        
                           x
                         along A–B is shown in 
                        Fig. 22(a), and the zoom-in stress results in Fig. 22(b). Q4 is the traditional Lagrange linear interpolation functions for the four-node rectangular element, and Q8 is the higher-order version of Q4. The stress results of Q4, Q8 for the fixed mesh 20×20 and reference in 
                        Fig. 22(b) is taken from [18]. Compare with the traditional Lagrange linear interpolation function, the B-spline functions yield better result for this problem. The result curve of the B-spline element method based on refined nodes is the closest to that of reference, which means that the accuracy can be improved by rearranging the distribution of the nodes

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A B-spline finite element method based on node moving adaptive refinement strategy is proposed in this paper. Since the elements are constructed in the practical domain, the method can also be seen as meshless method. A posteriori error indicator based on simple residual of partial differential equation was proposed to predict the areas of higher error in the numerical solution. The node moving strategy suggested in this paper is based on a simple principle which is that the number of nodes in certain area is proportional to the error. Particularly, a node moving algorithm which is suitable for one dimension is proposed. The method is tested by three benchmark examples which either have exact analytical solution or have previously analyzed by other authors. The numerical experiments showed the ability of the proposed methodology to effectively and efficiently solve elasticity problems.

Although the method performs rather well for the Euler–Bernoulli beam problem, the accuracy for the plane elastomechanics problem does not improved much when the nodes are refined. This is because that the two-dimensional B-spline basis functions are constructed through tensor product. Unlike pure meshless method such as the discrete least squares meshless method in which there is no limitation for the distribution of the nodes, the nodes of the B-spline finite element method for two dimensional problems are refined in only one dimension. It needs imagination to construct two dimensional B-spline bases just as the moving least square shape functions whose definition nodes are arbitrary. Nevertheless, this question will be a topic of a future paper.
