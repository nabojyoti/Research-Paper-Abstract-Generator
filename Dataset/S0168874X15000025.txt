                  A hierarchical modeling of planar steel frames that is based on a weak coupling of shell and beam computational models is studied in detail. A shell finite element is used to compute failure response of a representative part of each column and each beam of a frame under consideration; elasto-plasticity, geometrical nonlinearity and material softening (along with a localization limiter) are taken into account. The computed results, which naturally include local buckling and/or localized material failure effects, are further incorporated into a beam inelastic stress-resultant constitutive model; the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation Euler–Bernoulli finite element is considered in this work. The designed beam finite element formulation can be effectively used for the failure analysis of the steel frame. Important issues of such weak coupling concept are presented and results of several numerical simulations are discussed.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A hierarchical approach to structural modeling is advantageous in many engineering applications. In general, it involves coupling of a higher-level computational model with a lower-level one. In the hierarchical modeling of planar steel frames the shell and the beam finite element formulations can represent the former and the latter, respectively. The shell model can capture localized instabilities (of both material and geometrical types) that are completely unseen by the beam model; however, the modeling effort and the computational cost could be very large if only shell elements are used to model the entire structure. The beam model offers effective and robust analysis; the beam analysis results are also more suitable for the design purposes. By coupling the models, the best of both worlds can be combined. The coupling can be done in a strong way; in that case, the finite element model of a frame consists of beam and shell elements, as well as of constraints connecting both element types in a consistent manner (e.g. [39,9]). The coupling of the computational models can be also weak (e.g. [2,14]). In that case, the shell element is used to compute the failure response of a representative part of each subsystem of a frame under consideration; this information is further incorporated into the beam element that is used for the analysis of the entire frame. Thus, the weak coupling concept involves carrying out sequential shell and beam computations.

In this work, we present, illustrate, and make an assessment of the weak coupling concept for the analysis of planar steel frames made of I-cross-section beams and columns. We note that the concept can be also applied for other frame member geometries, e.g. with I-cross-section and transverse (and longitudinal) reinforcements (e.g. [34]). We aim to compute the response of a steel frame under static load beyond its limit point. In the earthquake engineering, this kind of computation is called the push-over analysis; we will call it here the failure analysis. An accurate yet fairly simple failure analysis of steel frames is of great practical interest. The failure analysis is an indispensable tool in order to obtain important design parameters, such as the limit load, the limit ductility, and the failure mode.

Under large loads, a frame member may undergo plastic deformations. Moreover, plastic strain localization (i.e. material softening) and local buckling may occur. Inelastic geometrically nonlinear beam finite elements cannot capture automatically those complex effects. However, they can be implicitly included into the beam finite element formulation by using the weak coupling concept suggested in [14] that can be summarized as:
                        
                           (a)
                           Use a geometrically and materially nonlinear (i.e. elasto-plastic) shell finite element formulation (see e.g. [8,31,29,7,16,40,36,11,15]) in order to study response of the representative part of a frame member (RPFM) up to its complete collapse. Such a response naturally includes local buckling and/or steel localized failure, since the RPFM fails due to a subtle combination of localized material failure and local buckling. The shell element should be able to model branching shells: either by using a shell formulation with the drilling rotation (see e.g. [18,19,25,42]) or by using a shell formulation with rotations that transforms the two local rotations into the three global ones at the nodes where different branches of the shell meet (e.g. [32]) or yet by using a rotation-less solid-shell formulation (e.g. [38,13]). Also, the effect of the mesh-dependency at steel softening (i.e. at localized steel failure) has to be minimized. For that purpose a localization limiter (see e.g. [20]), or a more rigorous and complex approach, like the extended finite element method (X-FEM) (see e.g. [3,4]), is to be used.

Incorporate the results obtained by the shell finite element into the stress-resultant beam inelastic constitutive model. In this work, we make use of the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation Euler–Bernoulli beam finite element described in [5,14,21], which can model perfectly well, without mesh-dependency, the cross-section softening as well as the frame softening. The geometric nonlinearity has to be taken into account in the beam formulation, at least in its simplest form of the von Karman type (see e.g. [27,14]).

Use the beam finite element, designed under (b) above, for an effective failure analysis of the entire steel frame; such an analysis is fast and implicitly takes into account localized failures of frame members. An arc-length method that functions well for softening problems has to be applied in order to be able to perform complete failure analysis (see e.g. [26,35] and references therein).

In what follows, we study in detail some aspects of the above described weak coupling concept that were not given attention in [14]; yet they are of highest importance for its practical use. We discuss, in particular, the following issues: (i) the choice of the length of the representative part of the frame member, (ii) the consistent incorporation of the results of the shell computations into the beam finite element formulation, (iii) the ability of the von-Karman-type nonlinearity to approximate the global geometrically nonlinear effects of a frame structure, (iv) the choice of the cross-section yield criterion, (v) the comparison of the results of shell computations with other engineering approaches that can be used to obtain the moment–curvature relation for a beam cross-section, (vi) the ability of the presented weak coupling concept to accurately predict the limit load, the limit ductility, the failure mode, and the failure response of a steel frame. By studying the above, a fairly complete assessment of the weak coupling procedure proposed in [14] is given; this is also the main motivation for the present work.

The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. The weak coupling concept for steel frame analysis is briefly presented in Section 2. The shell and the beam finite elements that are used in this work are described in Section 3. In Section 4, the results of shell computations for HEA340 and HEB300 are presented and discussed. In Section 5, examples of steel frame analysis are shown and conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

A weak coupling procedure of shell and beam computational models is presented in this section.

By using shell finite elements, we compute response of a representative part of a frame member (RPFM) (
                        Fig. 1), under a constant value of the end-force 
                           N
                         and a changing value of the end-moment 
                           M
                        . The geometric nonlinearity and the 
                           
                              
                                 J
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                         elasto-plasticity are taken into account (see e.g. textbooks [10,6,12,20] for general disposition on those topics). Any of the elasto-plastic geometrically nonlinear shell finite element formulations, mentioned in Section 1(a), is a good candidate to be used. Considering symmetry, only one half of the RPFM is modeled. Several possible boundary conditions are shown in 
                        Fig. 2: in this work, the boundary conditions (a2) with the deformation-following end-force 
                           N
                         are applied; in [14] the boundary conditions (c1) were used. In all the cases, shown in Fig. 2, the non-clamped end is constrained to the centroid of the corresponding cross-section by the rigid kinematic links.

In the analysis, the end-force 
                           N
                         is applied first; positive 
                           N
                         induces tension. Next, the rotation of the non-clamped end is increased at holding the value of 
                           N
                         fixed – up to the complete structural failure of the RPFM. In order to minimize the mesh-dependency of results, due to a use of the strain-softening plasticity, one has to use a localization limiter. We use the simplest localization limiter among long list of possibilities (see e.g. [20]) the linear stress–strain softening modulus is adjusted with respect to the characteristic length of the elements in the mesh:

The aim is to perform an analysis of the RPFM with the axial force and the bending moment being constant along its length. However, we can only have an approximate constant stress state along the length of the RPFM due to the geometrical nonlinearity. Neither the axial force of the cross-sections equals exactly 
                           N
                         nor the cross-sections bending moment equals exactly 
                           M
                        . In what follows, we will neglect the former fact; we will assume that the axial force at any cross-section along the RPFM equals to the applied end-force 
                           N

                         is the plastic work done in the softening response of the RPFM.

The beam computational model that is considered in this work is the stress-resultant embedded-discontinuity Euler–Bernoulli finite element, which is briefly described in Section 3.2 below (see also [5,14,21]). Its special feature is that the bending softening hinge is activated within an element at the outset of the failure process of a critical cross-section. Thus, it needs two material models; one for the bulk of the beam and one for the softening hinge. Due to the Euler–Bernoulli-type beam finite element, the constitutive relation for the shear force is not needed; the axial response is assumed as elastic.

As for the material model for the bending of the bulk of the beam, we choose the stress-resultant elasto-plasticity with a linear isotropic hardening (see 
                        Fig. 6 (left) and 
                        Fig. 7 (left)); the

                           0
                         is the bending hardening modulus. The interaction between the beam bending moment and the beam axial force is taken into account implicitly by making bilinear moment–curvature curve dependent on the level of the axial force. As for the beam bending softening hinge, we choose the rigid-plasticity with a linear softening with the modulus

                         (see Fig. 6 (right) and Fig. 7 (right)); the softening line also depends on the level of the axial force. Detailed derivation of the beam stress-resultant bending elasto-plasticity and beam stress-resultant bending rigid-plasticity can be found e.g. in [14,21] (see also [20] for the 1d elasto-plasticity). The parameters of the inelastic beam material models can be determined when curves from Figs. 3 and 5 are available for several levels of the axial force; recall that it is assumed throughout this work that the axial force is constant along the RPFM and equals to N.

In version (b), Eq. (14) remains unchanged. The case (b) was assumed in [14]. However, locations of softening regions, as predicted by shell computations in Section 4, indicate that case (a) is more common. Fig. 54 in Appendix shows that in the shell computations one softening region (that can be associated with one softening plastic hinge of the beam model) develops per one half of the RPFM. Hence, in the numerical examples below case (a) is assumed, and Eq. (15) is applied to compute

                           Instead of (11), one may use the following criterion for the plastic yielding of a beam cross-section

For shell computations we used a commercial computer code [1] and its 8-node quadrilateral shell finite element S8R5 with reduced mid-surface integration scheme and 5 integration points through the shell thickness. The von Mises small strain elasto-plastic stress-based material model with linear isotropic hardening and linear strain-softening was applied. In all computed cases the finite element mesh consisted of square elements with edge length

The implementation and the computational issues, related to the above described element, will be omitted in what follows. We mention that no static condensation of 
                           α
                         is performed; thus, the element has the stiffness matrix of (7×7). This is a major difference between the here used element and the one presented in [14]. Recall that the moments

                         and

                         are obtained by using inelastic constitutive relations, briefly discussed in Section 2.2. Note that only the bounded part of

                        , i.e.

                         (see (24)), should be used for evaluation of 
                           
                              
                                 M
                              
                              
                                 b

                        . The axial response of the beam is assumed as elastic.

In order to assess how the derived beam finite element can capture geometrically nonlinear effects, some elastic examples are presented in this section. The results shown below indicate that for moderate displacements the derived finite element provides results that are reasonably close to more exact solutions. Note that for pure bending problems, the derived finite element provides geometrically linear results.

The first example is presented in 
                        Fig. 14 (see e.g. [23]). The column is discretized with 8 elements of equal length. The beam is discretized with 2 equal length elements on the left to 
                           P
                         and 6 equal length elements on the right to 
                           P
                        . 
                        Fig. 15 shows the displacement 
                           u
                         as a function of force 
                           P
                        . It can be seen that the von-Karman-type of geometrical nonlinearity (“beam FE”) is reasonable close to the solution of [23] up to 
                           u
                           ≈
                           15
                           
                           
                           cm
                        .

The second example is the toggle frame from 
                        Fig. 16 (see e.g. [41]). Each beam is discretized with 7 elements of equal length. The displacement 
                           u
                         is plotted versus the applied force 
                           P
                         in 
                        Fig. 17 for clamped and pinned supports. It can be seen that for the pre-peak displacements the von-Karman-type of geometrical nonlinearity (“beam FE”) is reasonable close to the solution of [40] for clamped supports and to the geometrically nonlinear truss solution (“Analytical”) for pinned supports.

We can thus conclude that the applied von Karman geometrical nonlinearity can capture reasonable well the global geometrically nonlinear effects for moderate displacements.

We performed shell computations, described in Section 2.1, for two hot rolled profiles, the HEA340 and the HEB300 (see 
                        Table 1 and 
                        Fig. 18). We analyzed a corresponding RPFM under different levels of the end-force

There are several ways, apart from shell computations, to obtain ultimate capacity curve for a beam cross-section. One can use physical experiments. Strength of material-type calculations can be also used (e.g. [24]), but the effects of plastic hardening, geometric nonlinearity, local buckling, and strain localization are neglected in such calculations. Finally, suggestions from EC3 [17] can be applied. In 
                        Fig. 28, shell computations for HEA340 and HEB300 for a reference length

                         are compared to EC3 curves recommended by Eurocode 3 [17] (Section 6.2.9.1, Eqs. (6.31)–(6.38)), and to EM1 curves derived by using elementary strength of material calculations presented in 
                        Fig. 29. It can be seen that the EC3 curve is very close to the EM1 curve. On the other hand, the shell computations do not coincide with those curves.

In this section, we illustrate the above presented weak coupling concept by numerical examples. The shell computations were performed by Abaqus [1]. The above presented beam finite element was implemented into a finite element code AceFEM [22], which was used for beam computations. The analyzed frames consist of HEA340 and HEB300 profiles (
                     Table 6). The following finite elements models were used:

Failure curves from Fig. 25 were obtained for the compressive axial force

                                    . Shell computations on RPFM (see Fig. 23) suggest that the complete failure curve is not symmetric across

The “beam model2”, also denoted as BM2, is the embedded-discontinuity beam finite element (not described in detail in this work) that uses the two-curve yield criterion (16). The mayor difference between the BM and the BM2 is in implementation of the stress-resultant elasto-plasticity with hardening. We choose to define the hardening modulus of the BM2 as

In order to be able to make a comparison of the results of the weak coupling procedure with more accurate results, the entire frames are analyzed with shell finite elements [1]; this is called the “shell model”, also denoted as SM. The middle axes of a frame discretized by the beam elements correspond to the middle axes of a frame discretized by the shell elements. Each shell mesh consists of square elements with edge length of

Two different types of analysis were performed: (i) elastic geometrically nonlinear (EGNL) and (ii) elasto-plastic geometrically nonlinear (EPGNL). For EGNL, the above mentioned finite element models were used with simple elastic constitutive relations.

                         is reached at a very small horizontal displacement

In the BM analysis, the softening plastic hinges do not appear at all. The material softening is not predicted by the SM either. In the BM2 analysis, the softening plastic hinges appear but the hardening plasticity is not activated. The reason for that is that a failure curve (35) or (36) is lower than the yielding curve (16) at a higher level of the axial force (as illustrated in 
                        Fig. 37), thus the critical cross-section failure (due to local buckling) starts before its yielding. The plastic work for the BM is done only due to material hardening, and the plastic work for the BM2 is done only due to material softening. This results in different post limit point curves in Fig. 36 and different shapes of deformed configurations shown in 
                        Fig. 38.

This example differs from the previous one (Fig. 33) only in a vertical loading. The fixed value of a vertical force is lowered to 500kN (Fig. 33), and

                        Figs. 40 and Fig. 42 show the results. For EGNL analysis, there is hardly any difference between the beam and the shell results before

                        ; after that the SM gives lower response curve, which can be attributed to a local buckling (
                        Fig. 41). Nevertheless, the von Karman beam geometrical nonlinearity fits nicely with the exact geometrically nonlinear formulation of the SM up to an appearance of a local buckling in the SM. For EPGNL analysis (
                        Fig. 42) the limit load factor λ of the BM2 (
                           λ

                        ) are close; it is lower for the BM. With respect to the 1st portal frame example, a difference in computed limit loads is smaller due to a lower level of vertical load; also, the

                         at maximum λ is about two times larger comparing to the 1st portal frame example.

The BM reaches the limit load before activation of any softening plastic hinge. No softening is observed either in the SM results. On the other hand, the BM2 activates softening plastic hinges without appearance of the hardening plasticity (see Fig. 42) and the 1st portal frame example for an explanation for that. The post limit point responses of the BM and the BM2 differ from the SM, as shown in Fig. 42. Deformed configurations are shown in 
                        Fig. 43. 
                        Fig. 44 illustrates locations of the softening plastic hinges predicted by the BM2.

                        . Among those models, the latter two provide the results that are closest to the SM results. However, each beam curve differs from the shell curves after a corresponding beam curve limit point (see Fig. 47). The plastic work done by the BM and the BM2 models is very similar (see 
                        Fig. 48); these two beam models predict slightly lower plastic work than the shell model (see 
                        Fig. 49). The deformed configurations are shown in 
                        Fig. 50; it can be seen that the SM and the BM2 predict similar failure modes. It can be seen from 
                        
                        Figs. 51 and 52 that the BM2 predicts column softening hinges one story higher than the BM. Accumulation of plastic deformations in the SM is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 53.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A weak coupling concept for steel frame failure analysis has been studied in detail in this work. The following can be concluded:
                        
                           (i)
                           The length of a representative part of a frame member, 
                                 
                                    
                                       L
                                    
                                    
                                       r
                                       e
                                       f
                                    
                                 
                              , which is used to perform the shell computations, is of relative importance. The results of the computed examples suggest that the following recommendation can be made: 
                                 
                                    
                                       L
                                    
                                    
                                       r
                                       e
                                       f
                                    
                                 
                               should preferably equal twice the height of a cross-section. However, 
                                 
                                    
                                       L
                                    
                                    
                                       r
                                       e
                                       f
                                    
                                 
                               can be also larger; a length up to e.g. four times the height of a cross-section is acceptable.

The consistent incorporation of the results of the shell computations into the beam finite element formulation can be done nicely (within the framework of the weak coupling concept) by equating either the plastic works or the plastic dissipations of the beam and the shell models for a representative part of a frame member. In such a way, an ad-hock tuning of the beam moment–curvature and moment–rotation relations in order to comply with the results of shell computations can be avoided.

The von-Karman-type geometrical nonlinearity, applied in a beam model, can successfully approximate the global geometrically nonlinear effects of a frame structure. Of course, the larger are the deformations, the worse are the approximations. However, the computed examples show that for moderate displacements, the von-Karman strains work fine with respect to a more exact nonlinear strain formulation.

The choice of the cross-section yield criterion has a considerable influence on the results of the beam models. If a simple first-fiber-yield criterion is used, the results are more conservative (with respect to a refined shell finite element analysis of a complete frame) compared to the two-curve yield criterion. The difference is more pronounced for a higher level of the axial force as illustrated by the portal frame examples.

A comparison of results of the shell computations (within the framework of the weak coupling concept) with some other engineering approaches that can be used to obtain the moment–curvature relation for a beam cross-section show that other approaches are more conservative. The reason is that they are practically all based on the strength of material calculations. In such a way, they neglect the effects of plastic hardening, geometric nonlinearity, local buckling, and strain localization, which are all taken into account in shell computations in the framework of the weak coupling concept.

Numerical examples show that the presented weak coupling concept can predict the limit load and the limit ductility of a steel frame nicely and relatively accurately. These predictions are on one hand conservative (i.e. on the safe side) and on the other hand more realistic from those using a predefined moment–curvature relation for a beam cross-section obtained by other widely used engineering approaches. A steel frame failure mode can be also predicted nicely with the presented weak coupling concept. The softening plastic hinges pop up automatically during an analysis. Numerical examples also illustrate that a prediction of post-limit-point response of a steel frame with the presented weak coupling concept may not be very accurate.

In conclusion, the studied weak coupling concept for steel frame failure analysis has a great potential to be successfully used for practical applications.

                     Fig. 54 shows that in the shell computations one softening region (that can be associated with one softening plastic hinge of the beam model) develops per one half of the RPFM. For an illustration, the deformed configurations of one half of the RPFM (at
