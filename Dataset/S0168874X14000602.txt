                  External coupling software based on the coupling algorithm proposed by Prakash and Hjelmstad (PH method) is compared to the previous external coupling software based on the GC (Gravouil and Combsecure) method. The salient features of multi-time-step partitioning methods are presented: they involve non-overlapping partitions and follow a dual Schur approach by enforcing the velocity continuity at the interface with Lagrange multipliers. The main difference between the two methods lies in the time scale at which the interface problem is solved: the micro-time scale for the GC algorithm and macro-time scale for the PH algorithm. During the multi-time-step co-computations involving two finite element codes (explicit and implicit FE codes), the tasks carried out by the coupling software PH-CPL, based on a variant of the PH algorithm, are illustrated and compared to the coupling software GC-CPL based on the GC algorithm. The advantage of the new coupling PH-CPL software is highlighted in terms of parallel capabilities. In addition, the PH-CPL coupling software alleviates the dissipative drawback of the GC method at the interface between the subdomains. Academic cases are investigated to check the energy features and the accuracy order for the GC and PH algorithms. Finally, explicit/implicit multi-time-step co-computations with GC-CPL and PH-CPL software are conducted for two engineering applications under the assumption of linear elastic materials: a reinforced concrete frame structure under blast loading striking its front face and a flat composite stiffened panel subjected to localised loads applied to its central frame.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The increasing complexity of numerical simulations involving multiphysics phenomena has boosted the development of partitioning approaches. In fluid–structure interactions, the partition is driven by both physical and computational considerations: phenomena expected in each medium are very different from the point of view of space and time scales, arguing for a natural partitioning of the problem. In structural dynamics such as a structure subjected to localised impact loads, a small part of the structure is expected to experience strong non-linear phenomena over a short duration along with high-frequency features, whereas the remaining structure would mainly be concerned with linear low-frequency vibrations over a much longer duration. Then the choice of the subdomain decomposition of the whole mesh is driven by computational consideration: adopting different time steps and time integrators (explicit or implicit) depending on the partitions of the structure is much more advantageous in terms of computation times than a fixed time step depending on the smallest finite element in the mesh when considering conditionally stable time integrators such as the explicit central difference scheme.

Partitioning approaches are also very appealing with a view to coupling dynamic parts of heterogeneous systems in the context of hybrid (experimental/numerical) real time testing which requires different explicit or implicit time integration schemes in different subdomains (i.e. substructures) depending on their complexity and characteristics. The purpose of such hybrid experimental/numerical testing such as continuous pseudo-dynamic testing (PsD) is to test a key region of interest while the remainder of the structure is numerically handled. Typically, fewer degrees of freedom are considered for the tested part but with a large number of small time steps, advocating the use of explicit time integration schemes or other non-iterative schemes such as the α-operator splitting method [1]. In contrast, the numerical part may involve a large number of degrees of freedom with a large time step, which is efficiently handled by an implicit time integration scheme. As a consequence, the hybrid numerical–experimental testing techniques require high-performance coupling methods from the field of computational mechanics to be able to trigger the physical and numerical parts to interact in real time.

A great deal of research on partitioning approaches has been published in the literature since the pioneering work of Hughes and Liu in 1978 [2,3], and Belytshko and Mullen in 1976 [4–6]. These time integration procedures followed a primal approach, that is, the solution of the kinematic quantities (primal field) is obtained by solving the interface problem. The procedures refer to mixed time integration methods when different time integrators are considered, and subcycling or multi-time-step methods when different subdomain time steps are used in the mesh. Domain decomposition is based on nodal partitioning or element partitioning [7–18].

The alternative approach to the primal subdomain decomposition methods is the dual approach, characterised by an interface problem whose unknowns are dual quantities, Lagrange multipliers, representing the interface forces between the subdomains. This approach has been popularised by the success of finite element tearing and interconnecting method (FETI) developed by Farhat and Roux [19], first for static problems and subsequently extended to dynamic problems [20]. The FETI method uses non-overlapping subdomains and provides a very useful framework for building new coupling algorithms such as the multi-time-step integration method proposed by Gravouil and Combescure, labelled the GC method [21]. The stability of the GC method is demonstrated for Newmark time integrators by studying the sign of the interface pseudo-energy using of the so-called energy method, as first proposed by Hughes [22] for demonstrating the stability of mixed time integration methods. The interface pseudo-energy remains equal to zero when the same time step is employed in the subdomains and becomes negative when different time steps are adopted. In terms of accuracy orders, the artificial energy dissipation results in the loss of one order of accuracy when second-order accurate Newmark time integrators with different time steps are coupled. Furthermore, the GC method proposed for Newmark schemes in linear dynamics has been extended to non-linear dynamics [23], explicit non-linear dynamics with non-matching meshes at the interface [24], and coupling subdomains described according to a modal approach [25]. Prakash and Hjelmstad [26] dealt with the energy dissipation issue at the interface by extending the GC method.

The main difference of the PH method lies in the time scale at which the interface problem is solved: contrary to the GC method whose interface problem is solved at the fine time scale, the interface problem is solved at the large time scale. It has been proven that the PH method is energy conserving in the sense that the interface pseudo-energy remains equal to zero. The partitioning method turns out to be stable and of second-order accuracy when Newmark second-order accurate time integrators are considered. In the context of first-order systems, a FETI-based domain decomposition technique has been developed by Nakshatrala et al. [27] enabling arbitrary numerical schemes to be coupled.

The development of hybrid experimental/numerical testing methods has fostered the tailoring of the previous subdomain methods, by investigating the suitability of primal [28] and dual [29] approaches for these particular heterogeneous subsystems. Indeed, the staggered nature of the GC method constitutes a severe drawback in the context of the PsD tests in which experimental and numerical tasks have to be conducted in a concurrent way. Consequently, a new interfield parallel integration procedure, called the PM method from the authors’ names (Pegon and Magonnette), has been described by Bonelli et al. [30] by coupling Newmark time integrators. Recently, further work has been undertaken by Bursi et al. [31] to build a coupling method able to handle the generalised-α schemes proposed by Chung and Hulbert [32], well known for their optimal numerical dissipation properties by filtering out the high frequencies of the response without altering the low frequencies. Nonetheless, it has been pointed out that generalized-α schemes have to be adapted to the end time collocation format of the GC method along the lines of Arnold and Bruls [33].

In Section 2 of this paper, the salient features of the GC algorithm are reviewed as well as the discrete energy balance equation [22,34] in order to accurately assess the spurious energy dissipated at the interface. The next section is devoted to the PH method which enables the energy drawback at the interface to be alleviated, by solving the interface problem at the macro-time scale. It will be emphasised that some unbalanced free terms at the micro-time scale are required in the classical PH algorithm found in the literature [26,35]. An improved variant of the PH algorithm, noted as modified PH algorithm, is proposed by deriving a new form of these unbalanced free forces. In Section 4, on the basis of this modified PH algorithm, new coupling software, called PH-CPL, is set up and compared to the coupling software based on the GC algorithm (labelled GC-CPL). Finally, numerical examples are presented in the last section. The first example is the academic case of the split-oscillator to assess the accuracy orders of the GC and modified PH coupling schemes. The second example is a simple clamped-free 2D beam subjected to a lateral end load. The third example concerns a reinforced concrete frame structure subjected to blast loads at its front face, simulated using both coupling software programmes (GC-CPL and PH-CPL). The last example deals with a flat plane panel, with stiffeners and frames, subjected to localised impact loads. Multi-time-step explicit/implicit co-computations using both GC and modified PH coupling software programmes show the accuracy and efficiency of the partitioning approach in comparison to the full-explicit computation.

First, the key points of the GC progenitor multi-time-step subdomain algorithm proposed by Gravouil and Combescure [21,23] are given: the method is FETI-based, that is, it follows a dual Schur approach, involving the dual variable, the Lagrange multiplier, to enforce the kinematic continuity of the velocity across the interface at the micro-time scale.

Second, in order to accurately assess the dissipated energy at the interface due to the GC method, the discrete balance energy equation is written in the case of a domain split into two subdomains handled with different Newmark time integrators and time steps.

The GC coupling method is based on a dual Schur complement formulation which consists in ensuring the velocity continuity across the interface between subdomains by means of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrange multipliers represent the interface forces between the two subdomains

Using the so-called energy method proposed by Hughes for demonstrating the stability of mixed explicit/implicit coupling scheme, it has been shown in [21] that enforcing the kinematic continuity in terms of velocity leads to a stable algorithm. More precisely, the pseudo-energy at the interface involved in the pseudo-energy balance equation is equal to zero for homogeneous time steps, whereas the pseudo-energy at the interface is negative when considering different time steps. The demonstration holds for any time integrators from the Newmark family.

The velocity constraint at the interface is ensured by means of Lagrange multipliers

                        , the linked and complete quantities belonging to the macro-subdomain

                         are computed before proceeding to another macro-time step.

It can be pointed out that the GC method is staggered because the computing tasks in different subdomains cannot be carried out in a concurrent way: first, the subdomain related to the macro-time scale has to be solved without considering the interface forces; then the subdomain related to the micro-time scale can be solved, by computing first the free quantities and second the linked quantities after solving the Lagrange multipliers; and finally, the linked quantities in the macro-subdomain are computed. The successive computation tasks carried out in the GC method in the case of different time steps can be found in earlier studies [36].

The staggered feature of the GC method and the time scale at which the interface problem is solved constitute two drawbacks to implementing the method in a parallel setting.

The dissipative drawback of the GC method has pointed out by several numerical applications in linear and non-linear dynamics [21,23]. The spurious dissipated energy can reach a few percent of the total energy for impact problems and earthquake engineering applications [36,37].

The discrete energy balance equation over a macro-time step is considered in order to scrutinise the artificial energy dissipated or generated at the interface in the case of multi-time-step algorithms. Krenk [34] derived the discrete form of the energy balance equation in the case of the Newmark algorithms. For a given subdomain, without considering structural damping, the energy balance equation over a time step can be written as

                        From the global discrete energy balance equation in Eq. (10), it can be seen that the interface energy can be computed in two different ways: first, by computing the unbalanced energy between the sum of kinetic, internal and complementary energies and the external energy; second, by directly computing the interface energy in (11) and (12) depending on the Lagrange multipliers. Both ways will be used in the following numerical examples so as to thoroughly check the discrete energy balance in Eq. (10).

Prakash and Hjelmstad [26] proposed a FETI-based method, which can be viewed as an extension of the GC method: the main difference lies in the velocity continuity, which is not enforced at the micro-time scale as for the GC method but at the macro-time scale. Enforcement of the velocity continuity at the macro-time scale results in a much more complex interface operator than the interface operator from the GC method. A slight variant of the PH method is proposed to derive an algorithm, denoted modified PH algorithm, which enables the computations on both subdomains to be conducted in a complete concurrent way. The flowchart of the modified PH method is given to highlight its enhanced parallel capabilities with respect to the GC method.

The method proposed by Prakash and Hjelmstad maintains the zero value of the interface pseudo-energy in the sense of the energy method [26], contrary to the GC method for which the interface pseudo-energy is negative when different time steps are adopted [23]. The key difference from the GC method is the enforcement of the velocity continuity by Lagrange multipliers at the macro-time scale rather than at the micro-time scale. The discrete velocity continuity at the end of the macro-time step (at time

                        Table 1. From Table 1, it can be verified that the expression of the interface operator 
                           
                              
                                 H

                         in Eq. (6) is retrieved when the same time step is considered in both subdomains (taking j=m for the task (2B)): in this case, the PH method matches the GC method. In the case of different time steps, the interface operator of the PH method turns out to be much more time-consuming than the GC interface operator because it requires the iterative computing of the matrices

                         for
                           j
                           =
                           1
                           …
                           m
                        .

It is interesting to note that the resolution of the free problem is staggered in the PH method because the unbalanced free interface forces 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                         in the subdomain related to the macro-time step are required before proceeding to the computations in the subdomain related to the micro-time step (Eq. (22)). Consequently, free computations cannot be carried in a concurrent way in both subdomains. In contrast, it can be observed that link computations can be completely parallelised once the Lagrange multipliers are established at the macro-time scale. In the following, the unbalanced free interface forces 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                         will be expressed in a new form so as to make the free computations independent on both subdomains.

It is useful to make the computation of the free problem in subdomain

                         completely independent from the free problem in subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω

                        . For this purpose, the PH interpolation relationships in displacement and acceleration (given in Eq. (16)) are incorporated into the expression of the unbalanced free interface forces

                        This gives a clear advantage to the previous expression of the unbalanced free terms in Eq. (17) because the interpolation of free quantities obtained in the macro-subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 A
                              
                           
                         is no longer required: only Lagrange multipliers at the beginning of the macro-time step are required. Thus the free computations in subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω

                         can be carried out without waiting for the quantities from the free problem in subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω

                        . It can be noted that a projected unbalanced external force appears in the final expression. In practice, since the external forces applied on the subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 A
                              
                           
                         are often assumed to be linear on the macro-time step, this contribution disappears.

By employing the new expression of the unbalanced free interface forces 
                           
                              
                                 S

                        , a variant of the PH algorithm, called the modified PH algorithm, can be derived with enhanced parallel capabilities in comparison to the original PH algorithm. The flowchart is given in 
                        Table 2.

The three stages to solve the kinematic quantities over a large time step are given in Table 2. The flowchart of the modified PH method is related to subdomains 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 A
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 B
                              
                           
                        , assigned to the macro- and micro-time scales, respectively. Stage (2) is the initialisation of the subdomain computation by building the interface operator as described in Table 1.

Contrary to the original PH algorithm, the new expression of the unbalanced free interface term 
                           
                              
                                 S
                              
                              
                                 j
                              
                           
                         in Eq. (28) enables the free computations in both subdomains to be carried out in a parallel setting (stages (4A) and (4B)). Once final velocities have been obtained in both subdomains, the dual variables, the Lagrange multipliers, are computed using a direct solver in stage (5). For a large-scale simulation, the direct solver could be impractical, advocating an iterative solver as proposed in the FETI method [19,20]. In stages (6A) and (6B), linked quantities can be derived in a parallel setting in both subdomains. The final quantities can be obtained by summing free and linked quantities and another macro-time step in stage (7) can be carried out.

The purpose of this section is to present how explicit/implicit multi-time-step co-computation has been handled according to the GC and modified PH algorithms. Two external code coupling software programmes have been set up to make a first finite element code based on implicit time integration interact with a second finite element code based on explicit time integration.

In the following, we focus on building the PH coupling software, developed in C language, whereas the GC coupling software, presented in previous papers [36,37], is only briefly reviewed. Two finite element codes are connected to the coupling software: CAST3M (implicit or explicit) and Europlexus (explicit). Communication between processors uses pipe technology, making it possible to send or receive data from one process to another. For the PH coupling software, the building of the interface operator on the macro-time step is detailed in an initialisation stage before the co-computation. In comparison to the GC interface operator, the PH building operator turns out to be more complex. Finally, the successive tasks in a given macro-time step managed by the coupling software during the explicit/implicit multi-time-step co-computation are detailed.

First, the FE code Europlexus, a computer code being jointly developed since 1999 by Commissariat à l׳Énergie Atomique (CEA, CEN Saclay, DMT) and European Commission (Joint Research Centre, Ispra), uses an explicit algorithm for the discretisation in time (Europlexus [38]). It is best suited for fast dynamic phenomena taking into account the geometric non-linearities (large displacements, large rotations, large strains), and material non-linearities (plasticity, viscoplasticity, etc.). Second, the coupling software can operate with the FE code CAST3M, developed by the CEA (CEN Saclay, DMT). It provides a high-level programming language: the Gibiane language [39]. CAST3M code is well adapted to non-linear (geometric and material non-linearities) implicit dynamic analyses but can also be used for explicit analyses, by taking advantage of the flexibility of the Gibiane language for programming different time integration schemes.

The coupling software was developed in C language. The role of the coupling software during the co-computation is essentially to manage the data exchanges with the connected FE codes and to solve the small-size interface problem expressed at the micro-time scale for the GC algorithm and at the macro-time scale for the modified PH algorithm.

For parallel computing purposes, communication between computers classically uses standard protocols such as TCP/IP and MPI (Message-Passing-Interface). It enables parallel computing in a distributed architecture, associated with distributed memory, such as the heterogeneous parallel computing environment as discussed by Rama Mohan Rao [40,41].

In this work, the first purpose was to implement co-computation involving several FE codes on a given computer. Consequently, in the case of a given computer with several processors sharing the same memory, the pipes in C language, also called FIFO (first-in-first-out), constitute an elegant method to pass data directly from one process to another without the overhead of writing the data to the disk and then reading the data from the disk. The pipe mechanism provides a location in a file system where two processes can exchange without actually using files.

For each FE element code connected to the coupling software, for example the FE code dealing with the subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 A
                              
                           
                        , two pipes, associated with two locations in the file system, have to be created by the coupling software: the first one (FIFO1-SDA, reading pipe) reads data flow from the FE code SDA and the second one sends data flow to the FE code SDA (FIFO2-SDA sending pipe). Regarding the connected FE code SDA, the pipes must be opened on the opposite end before data can be passed. The pipes are opened in the sending direction to FIFO1-SDA and in the receiving direction from FIFO2-SDA, by targeting the locations in the file system of the previous two pipes.

Communication by means of pipes is very fast and does not require memory space in comparison to classical writing and reading in classical files. For example, the FE code SDA can send data to the FIFO1-SDA pipe as if it were a file, but nothing happens until the coupling software tries to read from that pipe.

Another important advantage in view of synchronising the computations between the FE codes and the coupling software is the blocking feature of the reading function through a pipe. For example, after invoking a reading function in the FE code SDA, the computation in subdomain 
                           
                              
                                 Ω
                              
                              
                                 A
                              
                           
                         is stopped, waiting for data coming from the coupling software. Therefore, we can ensure that the coupled code is waiting for Lagrange multipliers coming from the coupling software.

It is important to note that no direct communication between FE codes is allowed. The coupling software completely ensures the interface between the two FE codes. In addition, the co-computations can be conducted without interfering in the parallel computing strategies employed by both FE codes.

The initialisation stage for the co-computation is devoted to building the interface operator as given in Table 1.

Once the pipes needed for communication between FE codes have been created, denoted SDA and SDB, and the coupling software, denoted CPL, the coupling software requires data for building the interface operator 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 G
                                 C
                              
                           
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 H
                              
                              
                                 P
                                 H
                              
                           
                        . The coupling software does not know the typology (coordinates of nodes) in subdomains SDA and SDB: it only receives vectors and matrices associated with the degrees of freedom at the interface from both subdomains. This strategy is very effective but is limited to the case of matching meshes at the interface.

The first step for building the interface operator H is to compute the following matrices related to the subdomains

                         and

For the PH algorithm, an iterative computation of the interface operator is carried out by looping on the micro-subdomain SDB as given in Table 1. This iterative computation over the macro-time step is only handled by the FE code associated with the SDB.

                         is obtained by solving a linear system involving the dynamic operator matrix of the subdomain SDB and finally the computation of the complete matrices

                         is sent through the sending pipe of the FE code SDB and is read by the PH coupling software. Finally, the PH interface operator

                         takes the same form as the one given in Eq. (31).

The computation time for constructing the PH interface operator clearly comprises overhead in terms of computation time in comparison to the GC method.

Once the interface operator has been obtained, the co-computation is carried out between the actors of the co-computation (the coupling software and the two FE codes for subdomains SDA and SDB) over the macro-time step

From Fig. 1, one can check that no data exchange occurs directly between the two FE codes. Apart from the initial building of the PH interface operator, the mission of the PH-CPL exclusively consists in receiving free velocities from the FE codes and sending back the computed Lagrange multipliers.

Contrary to the building of the interface operator which is much more time-consuming in the PH algorithm, the requirements in terms of data exchanges in comparison to the GC algorithm are clearly alleviated, as highlighted in Fig. 1. Indeed, the GC coupling software has to communicate 
                           2
                           m

                         from the FE code SDB, and one direction for sending back the computed Lagrange multipliers

                           2
                         data exchanges are involved in the computation in the FE code SDB: the PH-CPL reads the last free velocities

                                 B
                              
                           
                         from the FE code SDB and sends back the computed Lagrange multipliers 
                           
                              
                                 Λ

                         at the end of the macro-time step. It can be concluded that the PH algorithm is far more efficient than the GC algorithm in terms of data exchanges.

On the other hand, as underlined above, the advantage in terms of parallel capabilities of the modified PH algorithm with respect to the GC algorithm is underlined. Free computations in subdomains

                         and 
                           
                              
                                 Ω

                         can be conducted concurrently (stages (4A) and (4B) in Table 2). The interface problem is solved once all the free computations have been completed in both subdomains and then, once again, linked computations in the subdomains

                                 Ω

                         can be conducted concurrently (stages (6A) and (6B) in Table 2). In contrast, all the tasks required in the GC algorithm are staggered: free computations in subdomain

The first academic example is a single degree of freedom problem involving an oscillator with a mass and a stiffness split into two masses and two springs linked together through a Lagrange multiplier. The order of accuracy will be checked for the GC and PH modified algorithms as well as the interface energy generated at the interface.

The second example is a beam composed of classical two-node beam finite elements, with two degrees of freedom per node. Finite element modelling is partitioned into two equal length subdomains, the first one handled with an average acceleration scheme and the second one with a central difference scheme. The interface energy induced by the multi-time-step coupling algorithms investigated will be carefully examined for a fixed time step ratio between subdomains and for a decreasing size of the macro-time step. Coupling between a dissipative Newmark scheme with the central difference scheme is also investigated. These two academic examples are sufficiently simple to be implemented in a Matlab software environment.

The third example is a reinforced concrete frame structure of engineering interest in the field of earthquake-resistant construction. The structure has also been studied under blast loading, with or without subdomain partitioning in the case of non-linear material behaviour for the concrete and the reinforcement using the GC algorithm [37]. Under the assumption of linear elastic behaviour for the constitutive materials, these co-computations are carried out using both coupling software programmes (GC-CPL and PH-CPL) so as to highlight the conserving energy features of the modified PH algorithm in comparison to the GC algorithm. The CAST3M code is used for both implicit and explicit partitions.

Finally, the last example consists of a flat plane panel used as a case study within the European research program MAAXIMUS (More Affordable Aircraft through eXtended, Integrated and Mature nUmerical Sizing). The panel is assumed to be impacted on a localised area handled with an explicit time integrator (central difference scheme) with a fine time step, whereas the remainder of the structure is integrated in time according to an implicit scheme (average acceleration scheme) with a large time step. Both coupling software programmes (GC-CPL and PH-CPL) are employed, connecting two different FE codes. The following computations and co-computations are conducted:
                        
                           •
                           Full-explicit computation with the CAST3M code, providing the reference results.

Multi-time-step explicit-implicit co-computations with the CAST3M code for both partitions.

Multi-time-step explicit-implicit co-computations with the CAST3M code for the implicit partition and Europlexus code for the explicit partition.

To check the accuracy order of the modified PH algorithm, a split single degree of freedom (SDOF) mass–spring system is studied: an undamped oscillator is artificially decomposed into two subdomains, with different time steps, and linked together with a Lagrange multiplier. The split SDOF mass–spring system is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 2.

The equilibrium equation, continuous in time, of the undamped oscillator characterised by the angular frequency ω, under free vibrations is

                        Fig. 3: the total energy corresponds to the sum of the internal, kinetic and complementary energies, whereas the unbalanced energy is the difference between the total energy and the initial elastic energy stored in the oscillator. The spurious dissipated energy is clearly highlighted in the case of the GC algorithm, reaching 14% of the initial elastic energy at the end of the simulation. This drawback is not observed with the modified PH algorithm.

In the case of the multi-time-step GC algorithm, the errors in terms of displacements, velocities and accelerations are plotted versus the reduced angular frequency of the subdomain SDA in 
                        Fig. 4, along with slopes corresponding to the accuracy order equal to 1 or 2. It is shown that the convergence rate is reduced by one order when different time step sizes are involved, as already highlighted in Mahjoubi et al. [42]. In the case of the multi-time-step modified PH algorithm, the convergence rate remains equal to 2 for multi-time scales as shown in 
                        Fig. 5. Like the PH algorithm, the modified PH method algorithm achieves a second order of accuracy, corresponding to the minimum of the orders of accuracy among the time integrators involved in the partitioned simulation. It has been checked that results obtained from the modified PH algorithm exactly match the results from the PH algorithm.

Furthermore, it is useful to compute the spurious interface energy when decreasing the size of the macro-time step, with a fixed time step ratio m equal to 100. For both the GC and modified PH algorithms, the interface energy error is computed as follows:

In the case of the modified PH algorithm, it can be highlighted that the relative energy error is very weak (almost negligible) but is not exactly equal to zero, contrary to the pseudo-energy at the interface, which is equal to zero, as proved by the authors using the energy method. This small error in the classical norm of the energy is equal to less than

Since each node has two degrees of freedom, the interface operator H involved in the subdomain computation has a dimension of

In 
                        Fig. 8, the lateral top displacements predicted by the GC and modified PH algorithms are plotted versus time: both predictions match very well at the beginning of the vibration (top graph) but not at the end of the simulation, where it can be seen (bottom graph) that the amplitude of response cycles predicted by the GC algorithm are damped in comparison to the response cycles obtained by the modified PH algorithm. The interface energy versus time for both algorithms, computed from the unbalanced energy or directly from the Lagrange multipliers, is shown in 
                        Fig. 9. The two ways for computing the spurious interface energy (

It can also be seen that the GC algorithm dissipates some energy at the interface; the dissipated energy regularly increases in absolute value over time, reaching an interface energy error of 6%, as defined in Eq. (34). In contrast, the interface energy induced by the modified PH algorithm is not strictly equal to zero, as previously observed when using split oscillator, but remains bounded, with an interface energy error less than 1.4%.

The case of an implicit dissipative α-Newmark scheme is considered by choosing the parameter

                        . The resulting time integrator is known to provide high-frequency dissipation with an alteration of the low frequencies as well, indicated by the loss of one order of accuracy with respect to the previously investigated time integrators. This dissipative scheme is coupled with a central difference scheme in order to assess the effect of GC and modified PH algorithms in the case of a dissipative time integrator. It can be seen in 
                        Fig. 10 that, once again, the GC algorithm damps the response more in terms of displacement than the modified PH algorithm. This observation is confirmed by the bottom graph in Fig. 10 in which the unbalanced energy coming from the two coupling methods are compared: dissipated energy emerges from both coupling algorithms, including both the dissipated energy in subdomain SDA assigned to the dissipative Newmark integrator (

                         in Section 2.2); the unbalanced energy coming from the modified PH algorithm remains less than that due to the GC algorithm. It can be concluded that the modified PH algorithm remains more advantageous from the energy point of view than the GC algorithm in case of dissipative time integrators.

                        in the case of non-dissipative Newmark integrators (constant average acceleration with central difference schemes). The interface energy errors coming from the GC and modified PH algorithms are plotted versus the size of the macro-time step in 
                        Fig. 11. The interface energy decreases as the macro-time step decreases. In the case of the modified PH algorithm, it can be highlighted that the relative energy error is clearly lower that in the case of the GC algorithm. In addition, it can be noted that the comparison is made for a large but limited duration of 1s. Fig. 9 already underlines that the dissipated energy at the interface induced by the GC algorithm regularly increases, whereas the interface energy for the modified PH algorithm remains bounded. Consequently, the longer the time duration, the larger the discrepancy is between the GC and modified PH algorithm in favour of the modified PH algorithm. The interface energy displayed with the modified PH algorithm can be viewed as some dynamic fluctuations which have no effect on the stability and the convergence rate of the multi-time-step scheme. In contrast, the GC algorithm produces spurious energy dissipated at the interface, which does not entail stability problems but reduces the convergence rate by one order of the magnitude.

The case of a non-earthquake-resistant reinforced structure under blast loading is considered. The model of the structure has been presented in a previous article [37]. Briefly, the model of the frame structure is composed of multi-fibre Timoshenko beam elements, whose cross section is discretised into material fibres for concrete and longitudinal reinforcement. Non-linear computations and multi-time-step explicit/implicit co-computations carried out demonstrated the relevance of the partitioning approach using the GC-CPL coupling software with the CAST3M code for both implicit and explicit partitions [37]. Here, the purpose is to assess the advantages of the PH-CPL coupling software in terms of energy dissipation at the interface in comparison to the GC-CPL coupling software. In 
                        Fig. 12, the complete mesh of the structure is illustrated (3D visualisation for exhibiting the cross section of the beam elements) as well as the partitioning assumed in the following co-computations: beam elements for columns and column beam joints are gathered into the explicit partition, whereas the remaining elements of the mesh (the FE beams without the joints) are included in the implicit partition with the macro-time step. Linear elastic behaviour is assumed for all the concrete and steel fibres with Young׳s modulus equal to 25,000MPa and 200,000MPa, respectively. Dead and live loads are taken into account as well as the blast loads applied to the front face of the structure. Details of the simulation can be found in [37].

Co-computations are carried out with both coupling software programmes, the GC-CPL and the PH-CPL, by making two CAST3M processes interact, dealing with either the implicit or the explicit partition. The time step ratio adopted between the macro-time step and the micro-time step is equal to 40. The reference results are provided by a fully explicit computation using the CAST3M code. 
                        Fig. 13 shows the comparison of the co-computations investigated and the reference results in terms of displacements and velocities in the direction of the blast load (Y-axis) at the top of the structure׳s C5 column. The almost perfect agreement between the results is highlighted.

The unbalanced energy (sum of kinetic, internal and complementary energies minus the external energy) is checked for both coupling approaches. From 
                        Fig. 14, it can be seen that the dissipated energy created at the interface by the GC algorithm cannot be neglected, whereas only very limited energy dissipation at the interface can be observed in the case of the modified PH algorithm.

A composite flat plane panel is considered in this last example. It has been proposed as a numerical case study in the framework of the MAAXIMUS European research program. The mesh of the composite plate panel is shown in

A last co-computation is added: it concerns the external coupling software GC-CPL operating with the CAST3M code for the implicit subdomain and the Europlexus code for the explicit subdomain.

In 
                        Fig. 18, vertical displacements and velocities from the fully explicit computation and the explicit/implicit multi-time-step co-computations are plotted at point P, previously displayed in Fig. 17. It can be seen that the multi-time-step co-simulations very accurately predict the displacements and velocities obtained by the fully explicit computation. The discrepancies observed for the co-simulation GC-CPL with the CAST3M and Europlexus codes can be explained by the different type of shell element adopted in the Europlexus code in comparison to the shell element adopted in the CAST3M code. The deformed meshes along with the unixial strain isovalues in the Y-direction (stiffener direction) are shown in 
                        Fig. 19 for the last time of the co-computation using the PH-CPL coupling software. It is visually confirmed that the two subdomains interact correctly between each other during the co-computation.

The last point concerns the verification of the energy-preserving property of the multi-time-step coupling modified PH algorithm. At the top of 
                        Fig. 20, the kinetic, internal and external energies are plotted versus time for the implicit subdomain SDA. External energy is equal to zero because the loads are only applied to the central area of the explicit subdomain. Separate unbalanced energy for both subdomains is added to the two graphs in Fig. 20; the unbalanced energy, positive in subdomain SDA due to the zero external energy, must be balanced with the unbalanced negative energy in subdomain SDB. This is confirmed by 
                        Fig. 21.

Finally, the computation time required for the fully explicit computation and the explicit/implicit multi-time-step computation are compared. The fully explicit computation requires 23,694s of CPU time. In the case of the explicit/implicit multi-time-step co-computation, the computation on the explicit subdomain SDB requires 168s, whereas the computation on the implicit subdomain SDA requires 966s. Consequently, the computation time has been reduced by a factor of approximately 20 in comparison to the fully explicit computation. It is worth noting that the computation gain provided by the multi-time-step co-simulation approach is mainly dependent on the number of degrees of freedom of the explicit subdomain with the fine time step. Here, the highly reduced explicit subdomain with respect to the implicit subdomain with the large time step, enables a large computation time gain to be achieved.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper is devoted to building coupling software for structural dynamics, making different finite element codes based on explicit and implicit time integration schemes interacting over time. Two multi-time-step coupling algorithms are investigated: the GC algorithm, proposed by Gravouil and Combescure, and the PH algorithm, proposed by Prakash and Hjelmstad. The main difference between the two algorithms lies in the time scale at which the interface problem is solved. An improved variant of the PH algorithm is proposed, noted as modified PH algorithm, which allows computations in subdomains in a completely concurrent manner. The coupling software based on the modified PH algorithm, noted as PH-CPL, provides enhanced parallel capabilities and alleviates the energy dissipation drawback at the interface between subdomains, reported in the literature and observed in this paper with the coupling software GC-CPL based on the GC algorithm.

The first numerical example is a simple split oscillator: using the modified PH algorithm, the second-order of accuracy is achieved, whereas the GC algorithm only leads to first-order accuracy when different time steps are considered. The second example, consisting of a simple clamped/free beam modelled with two-node beam elements subjected to a lateral force at the free end, confirms the spurious interface energy induced by the GC algorithm. Some energy fluctuations are also observed with the modified PH algorithm but they remain bounded to a low value and do not increase during the duration of the simulation.

The two following applications are presented by employing the coupling software GC-CPL and PH-CPL. The first example examines a reinforced concrete frame structure under a blast loading striking its front face, whereas the second concerns a flat composite stiffened panel subjected to localised loads applied to its central frame. Multi-time-step explicit/implicit co-computations with GC-CPL and PH-CPL software have been validated with respect to the fully explicit computations. Again, the non-dissipative feature of the PH-CPL software has been shown. Concerning the computation time, a reduction factor of 20 in comparison to the fully explicit computation was achieved. It is important to note that the GC method has already been validated for non-linear dynamics. Work is in progress to extend algorithms based on the macro-time scale for the interface problem, such as the PH algorithm and the MGC algorithm [43], to the case of non-linear dynamics problems.
