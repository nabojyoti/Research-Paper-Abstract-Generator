                  The paper presents results of FE analysis of mechanical size effects in longitudinally reinforced concrete slender beams without shear reinforcement failing in shear mode. The simulations were performed under plane stress conditions for three beams of different sizes and a fixed shape (height/length ratio). The attention was focused on deterministic and statistical size effects related to the nominal beam shear strength. Concrete was assumed as an isotropic elasto-plastic material exhibiting non-local softening. The bond strength between concrete and reinforcement was assumed to depend on interface slip with both stable and softening responses. Statistical simulations were performed for spatially correlated Gaussian random fields of tensile strength using a stratified sampling reduction method. The FE numerical results were compared with the respective own experimental test results.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The size effect phenomenon in quasi-brittle structures is related to a transition from a ductile behaviour of small specimens to a totally brittle response of large ones. Thus, the nominal strength σ
                     
                        N
                      decreases with increasing characteristic specimen dimension D. The reasons for this behaviour are: (a) intense strain localization regions with a certain volume (i.e. micro-cracked damage regions – called also fracture process zones, FPZ) which precede discrete macro-cracks; their size related to D contributes to a deterministic size effect and (b) a spatial variability/randomness of local material properties contributing to a statistical size effect that becomes dominant with increasing D.

A strong size effect also occurs in reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement wherein diagonal shear–tensile fracture takes place in concrete. It was experimentally observed among others by Leonhardt and Walther [1], Kani [2,3], Bhal [4], Taylor [5], Walraven [6], Chana [7], Iguro et al. [8], Bazant and Kazemi [9], Shioya et al. [10], Kim and Park [11], Grimm [12], Ghannoum [13], Kawano and Watanabe [14], Podgorniak-Stanik [15], Yoshida [16], Angelakos et al. [17], Lubell et al. [18] and Syroka-Korol [19]. The diagonal cracks at failure had in experimental tests essentially similar paths and relative lengths at the maximum load independently of the beam size. Therefore, this size effect in such reinforced concrete beams could be described by the analytical deterministic (energetic) size effect law (SEL) of Type II according to Bazant [20], being valid for structures of a positive similar geometry possessing large stress-free cracks that grow in a stable manner up to the maximum load (

                     0 are the empirical parameters depending on material properties, structure geometry and structure shape [21]. They can be determined by fitting Eq. (1) to the experimental data. The parameter D

                     0⪢D) from the brittle one (D
                     0⪡D). For very large structures (D→∞), the nominal strength approaches υ

                      for very large sizes (D→∞) due to the strength of reinforcement and compressed concrete, Eq. (1) becomes valid if υ
                     
                        N
                      is replaced by the expression υ

                     [21]. For small structures (D→0), the size effect disappears. Thus, the size effect is strong only in the limited size range. The SEL curve (Fig. 1b) in a double-logarithmic plot represents a smooth transition from a strength (plastic) limit for small sizes to the solution given by the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) for large and very large sizes.

In spite of the ample experimental evidence, the physically based size effect is not taken into account in practical design rules of engineering structures, assuring a specified safety factor with respect to the failure load [22,23]. Instead, a purely empirical approach is sometimes considered in building codes which is doomed to yield an incorrect formula since physical foundations are lacking.

Our objective is to provide a quantitative assessment of a size effect and a related description of a brittle failure mode in slender reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement under bending. The finite element method based on an isotropic elasto-plastic model with non-local softening enhanced by a characteristic length parameter of micro-structure was used in numerical studies. The plane stress 2D calculations were performed. Material parameters were calibrated with conventional laboratory tests and code recommendations. A characteristic length of microstructure was estimated by means of displacement measurements on the beam surface using the non-invasive Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique [24]. Deterministic calculations were performed assuming a constant value of the tensile strength. In turn, statistical analyses were carried out with spatially correlated random fields according to the Gauss distribution reflecting the random nature of a local tensile strength. In order to reduce the number of FE statistical simulations, a stratified sampling scheme was used belonging to a group of variance reduced Monte Carlo methods. This approach enabled us a significant reduction of the sample number without affecting the accuracy of calculations. The present analysis constitutes the continuation of our earlier successful simulations of a combined deterministic-statistical size effect in notched [25] and unnotched concrete beams [26].

The numerical results were compared with our laboratory experiments [19,27]. The experiments were carried out on longitudinally reinforced concrete beams of different sizes and fixed height/length ratio: 3 small-size beams of the height of 200mm and length 1500mm, 3 medium-size beams of the height of 400mm and length 3000mm and 3 large-size beams of the height of 800mm and length 6000mm (the thickness t=200mm). The beams were geometrically similar in 2 dimensions to avoid differences in the hydration heat effects which are proportional to the thickness of the member [22]. They and made from the same concrete mix with the mean aggregate diameter equal to 9mm. The simply supported beams were subjected to 4-point bending with the constant shear span-effective height ratio equal to 3. To induce a shear–tension failure mechanism in concrete, the beams were over-reinforced without shear reinforcement (the reinforcement ratio was always ρ=1%). The experimental results showed a significant size effect on the nominal shear strength versus the beam effective height. The mean nominal shear strength of large-size beams was smaller by 40% with respect to small-size beams. In all RC beams, a combined diagonal shear–tensile (significantly more tensile) and bond failure mode dominated, characterized by the development of a critical diagonal shear–tensile crack connected with a horizontal splitting crack along the top of the bottom longitudinal reinforcement toward the beam support (a shear–compression failure mechanism did not occur in concrete). The failure mode proceeded in a brittle manner in the post-critical stage.

Numerical FE analyses of slender beams without transverse reinforcement were performed among others by Kotsovos and Pavlovic [28,29], Vecchio and Swim [30], Sato et al. [31] and Slobbe et al. [32]. They used a non-linear elastic-brittle model ([28,29]), a smeared rotating crack approach [30], a smeared fixed crack approach with a sequentially linear (SL) analysis [32] and a discrete rotating crack model [31]. In calculations, a diagonal tensile brittle failure mode was usually obtained. A critical diagonal crack propagated towards the beam top, if the beam failure was caused by concrete splitting in a compression zone [32]. It propagated towards the bottom, if the beam failure was caused by bond splitting [31]. A deterministic size effect on the nominal shear strength of beams failing by diagonal tension was studied only by Sato et al. [31] for four virtual reinforced concrete beams with the height ranging from 100mm up to 1600mm. The numerical results were overestimated as compared to an analytical size effect formula. According to 3D simulation results in [28,29], the size effect in slender reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement is mainly caused by non-symmetric cracking combined with the unintended out-of-plane action, the latter being impossible to be avoided in experiments. They have also found out that stirrups eliminate the size effect in reinforced concrete beams (in contrast to recent outcomes by Yu and Bazant [33]).

Summarized, the novel elements in our calculations for reinforced concrete beams failing in shear are: (a) combined deterministic-statistical FE calculations for 3 different beams by taking strain localization and bond into account, (b) direct comparison between numerical and experimental results and (c) application of a stratified sampling scheme to reduce the number of statistical calculations. To our knowledge, such calculations have so far not been performed.

The concrete deformational response was simulated by assuming an isotropic elasto-plastic constitutive model with a non-local softening which was used in our previous calculations [19,26,34–36]. This relatively simple isotropic model for concrete (see Appendix) consists of two yield criterions: by Rankine in tension (Eq. (A1)) and by Drucker–Prager in compression (Eq. (A2)). The softening under tension (
                        Fig. 2a) was characterized by the exponential curve by Hordijk [37] (Eqs. (A7) and (A8)). In compression, linear hardening/softening was assumed (Fig. 2b).

The concrete model requires two elastic constants: modulus of elasticity E and Poisson׳s ratio ν, two plastic constants: internal friction angle φ and dilatancy angle ψ, one tensile yield function σ
                        
                           t
                        =f(κ
                        1) and one compressive yield function σ
                        
                           c
                        =f(κ
                        2). The disadvantages of the model are the following: the shape of the compressive failure surface in a principal stress space is linear (not paraboloidal as in reality). In deviatoric planes, the shape is circular (in compression states) and triangular (in tension states); thus it does not gradually change from a curvilinear triangle with smoothly rounded corners to nearly circular with increasing pressure. The effect of third stress deviator invariant is not taken into account. The strength is similar for triaxial compression and extension, and the stiffness degradation due to strain localization and non-linear volume changes during loading are not taken into account.

A non-local theory was used as a regularization technique [40–42]. In this approach, the principle of a local action does not take place any more. Polizzotto et al. [43] laid down a thermodynamically consistent formulation of non-local plasticity. In the calculations, the softening parameters κ

                         is a characteristic length of micro-structure and the parameter r is the distance between material points. The averaging in Eq. (3) was restricted to a small representative area around each material point (the influence of points at the distance of r=3l
                        
                           c
                         was only of 0.01%). The softening non-local parameters near boundaries and at both sides of a localized zone were always calculated on the basis of Eqs. (1) and (2) (which satisfy the normalizing condition) [36]. Other approaches were proposed by Polizzotto [45] and Jirásek et al. [46]. The reinforcement was not taken into account when calculating a non-local parameter in concrete [36]. To simplify the calculations, non-local rates were replaced by their approximations calculated with known total strain increments [42].

The non-local model was implemented in the commercial finite element code ABAQUS [47] with the aid of subroutine UMAT (user constitutive law definition) and UEL (user element definition) for efficient computations [42]. The calculations were carried out using a large-displacement analysis available in the ABAQUS code [47]. According to this method, the current configuration of the body was taken into account. The Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress was taken. The conjugate strain rate was the rate of deformation. The rotation of the stress and strain tensor was calculated with the Hughes–Winget method [48]. It is known that the stress and strain rate are not work conjugate in this formulation and erroneous results occur, in particular for highly compressible materials [49]. Our calculations showed however that the effect of large displacements on the failure force in reinforced beams was negligible (less than 1%). Thus the effect of a work conjugacy error was not important. The non-local averaging was performed in a current configuration. This choice was governed by the fact that element areas in this configuration were automatically calculated by ABAQUS [47]. The edge and vertex in the Rankine yield function were taken into account by the interpolation of 2–3 plastic multipliers according to Koiter׳s rule [50]. The same procedure was adopted in the case of combined tension (Rankine criterion) and compression (Drucker–Prager criterion).

To simulate the reinforcement behaviour, an elastic-perfectly plastic material with the von Misses criterion was assumed

To describe the interaction between concrete and reinforcement, a bond relationship was defined. In general, two different bond-failure mechanisms may appear connected to a pull-out or splitting mode. The pullout bond failure takes place when the bar anchorage length is insufficient to carry tensile stresses in the longitudinal reinforcement, whereas the splitting bond failure occurs when the concrete cover thickness is insufficient to resist radial cracks caused by local forces transmitted through bar ribs.

To consider bond model, an interface with a zero thickness was assumed along a contact surface, Since the bond model was crucial for describing numerically the experimental failure mechanism, three different bond stress–slip definitions were tested. Initially, the simple and well-known models proposed by Dörr [51] and CEB-FIP Model Code [39] were used which described the pull-out failure by a relationship between the bond shear stress τ and slip displacement δ. The first bond-slip model neglects softening and assumes a yield plateau when the pullout failure begins (
                        Fig. 3a). The model needs solely 2 parameters: the tensile strength f

                        )
                      was obtained by truncating the series in Eq. (17) after M terms. The resulting error was minimized by sorting eigenvalues in a decreasing order and controlling the sum of λ
                     i for i=1,…, M.

An analytical solution of Eq. (17) is available with e.g. an exponential autocorrelation function (Ghanen and Spanos [56]). In other cases, Eq. (17) has to be solved numerically. In our study, the wavelet-Galerkin method proposed by Phoon et al [57,58] was used wherein conventional bases (e.g. trigonometric or polynomials) were replaced by Haar wavelets. A family of the orthogonal Haar wavelets was created from a so called mother function

In order to reduce the number of statistical simulations, the so-called stratified sampling scheme originally proposed by Neyman [59] was used [60,61]. Initially 2000 random fields of the local tensile strength were generated for each beam size. Next, the generated samples were classified according to the sampling parameter, chosen as the mean tensile strength in two shear regions of beams (
                     Fig. 5) according to their failure mode. Thus, we assumed that the effect of the beam mid-region on the statistical failure force was negligible (the effect of the sampling region size on results merits further investigations). For the left and right shear region of Fig. 5, the mean value was separately calculated and afterwards the lower value was used. Next, the random fields were classified and arranged in an increasing order according to the calculated mean value. Based on the sampling parameter, the cumulative probability of an initially generated set of the random fields was calculated (
                     Fig. 6). Next, the cumulative probability function was divided into a finite number n of the equal intervals (P
                     
                        i
                     , i=1,…,n), where n corresponded to the number of samples. From each subset of samples included in the intervals of the equal probability, only one sample (nearest to the mid-point) was chosen for further FE analyses. Thus, the chosen representative set of n samples included random fields of the mean value in a shear region from the lowest to the highest one. We used the sampling procedure after the random fields were generated instead of sampling of on random vectors (Eq. (15)) during a random field generation [62] because of the influence of the input random vector on a random distribution. The sampling on output random fields enabled us to choose the samples in a critical localized zone of the beam shear region, being approximately representative for the beam failure force. Our method allows for a fast convergence to the mean failure force [60,61].

The FE-analyses of longitudinally reinforced concrete slender beams without shear reinforcement were performed with 3 different beam sizes of a similar geometry from experiments by Syroka–Korol [19]. The beams had the same dimensions H×L as in the experiments: 200×1500mm2 (small-size beam SL20), 400×3000mm2 (medium-size beam SL40) and 800×6000mm2 (large-size beam SL80) (
                     Table 1). All specimens had the constant thickness t=200mm and constant reinforcement percentage ρ=1% (
                     Fig. 7). The beams were subjected to 4-point bending (
                     Fig. 8) under the constant shear span to the effective depth ratio a/D=3. The numerical calculations were carried out under plane stress conditions since experimental crack patterns were very similar on both sides of all beams (
                     Fig. 9 shows these patterns in a medium-size beam).

The specimens were cast from concrete C35/45 of a maximum aggregate size 32mm (the characteristic compressive strength f

FE meshes of quadrilateral elements composed of four diagonally crossed triangles were used (
                     Fig. 10). The finite elements had mainly the area of 7.5×10mm2 (width×height) which was equal to (1.5–2)×l
                     
                        c
                      to obtain mesh-independent results [24,26]. In the case of the large-size beam, the fine mesh covered the beam mid-part of 4410mm only. Totally, 13′600–169′344 finite elements were used depending upon the beam size. The steel bars were modelled as 2D elements with the width of 1.5mm and height of 2.0–2.5mm depending on the bar diameter ϕ
                     
                        b
                     . Since our FE analyses were two-dimensional, the bar height was taken as 0.5×ϕ
                     
                        b
                      to obtain a similar contact surface as in experiments (2×0.5πϕ
                     
                        b

Using the model by Akkermann [52] only, a satisfactory agreement was achieved with experiments (Figs. 12 and 13). The ultimate vertical force from deterministic simulations was 91.4kN which was by 1% lower only than the average failure force from experiments (91.9kN). With the remaining bond models, the maximum vertical force was too high due to the different main failure mechanism assumed that was not consistent with the experimental failure mode (steel yielding instead of diagonal tension). The number of localized zones varied from 5 with the model by Dörr (1980) [51] and by CEB-FIP [39] (Fig. 13c) up to 8 with the perfect bond (Fig. 12a). Thus, the pattern of localized zones differed from the experimental one.

The evolution of localized zones was similar to the experimentally observed cracks with the bond model by Akkermann [52] (Fig. 13). First, vertical tensile bending localized zones appeared at the mid-region, next inclined shear localized zones developed in the shear span region, and finally a diagonal shear–tensile zone occurred connected to the splitting failure along reinforcement, where bond radial stresses σ
                     
                        r,rs
                      reached their residual value (marked as dashed line in Fig. 13e). A critical inclined localized zone occurred at the distance of d
                     
                        c
                     =270mm from the support with the ratio of d
                     
                        c
                     /a=0.56 being identical as the average experimental value from 3 tests. In total, 9 localized zones were calculated whose average spacing was 87mm (the average experimental crack spacing was also similar −91mm).

We investigated also the effect of plastic parameters φ, ψ, G
                     
                        f
                      and G
                     
                        c
                      on FE results. The effect of φ (with r
                     
                        bc
                     
                     
                        σ
                     =1.15–1.25) and ψ (with 8–12o) was negligible. The lower G
                     
                        f
                     , less localized zones appeared and a critical diagonal localized zone occurred at a higher distance from the support. In turn, the effect of G
                     
                        c
                      on a localized zones pattern and load capacity was negligible. The assumed softening curves of Fig. 2 with G
                     
                        f
                     =180N/m and G
                     
                        c
                     =2700N/m provided the most realistic FE results with respect to experiments.

The effect of the mesh size on the results is demonstrated in 
                     Fig. 14. The results show that the FE results with a fine and a coarse mesh are similar (Fig. 14A and B). The failure force for the coarse mesh (element size 15×20mm2) was 93kN while for the fine mesh (element size 7.5×10mm2) was 91kN (Fig. 14A). Based on these results, we assumed that there was no need to decrease more the size of finite elements (less than 7.5×10mm2).

The deterministic simulations were carried out with the constant tensile strength f
                        
                           t
                        =2.2MPa. The results showed a significant effect of a beam effective depth on the nominal shear strength. In analyses, the failure mechanism was similar in all beam sizes: after appearance of several localized zones in a pure bending region, some inclined localized zones started to develop in a shear region at the support which gradually propagated along a beam height during loading until they reached a compressive zone. The critical inclined localized zones (preceding failure), which occurred at the nearest distance x to the support (x≈a/2), were the last ones which occurred in the shear region. They initiated horizontal bond splitting failure zones along the reinforcement propagating simultaneously towards both supports (
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Figs. 17–19). A similar failure mode happened during laboratory tests, however a single horizontal splitting crack always appeared there.

                           n
                        ) and tangential (Δu

                        ) displacement increments across a diagonal localized zone during its propagation path (Fig. 15) in the small beam SL20. The dominant mechanism in a diagonal localized zone was normal extension. Both displacement increments Δu

                           t
                         gradually increased during deformation (e.g. Δu
                        
                           n
                         increased from 0.02mm up to 0.39mm, whereas Δu
                        
                           t
                         increased from 0.13mm up to 0.25mm across ‘EF’). However, the tangential displacement increment Δu
                        
                           t
                         reflected mainly the beam deflection.

The evolution of the vertical force versus the deflection was consistent with the experimental measurements for all beam sizes (Fig. 16). The calculated maximum vertical forces were: 91.4kN (small-size beam), 167.9kN (medium-size beam) and 263.9kN (large-size beam). Hence, the nominal shear strength, expressed by υ

                           N
                        =0.88MPa, respectively – it decreased strongly with the beam height. The calculated width of all localized zones was about w

A direct comparison between the experimental and numerical fracture pattern is demonstrated in 
                        Fig. 20. The critical diagonal localized zone occurred at the distance d

                           c
                        /a were 0.58 (SL40) and 0.54 (SL80). Thus, the numerical outcome was too small in the beam SL40 and realistic in the beam SL80. The average spacing of vertical localized zones s at the mid-region was equal to: 87mm (SL20), 150mm (SL40) and 324mm (SL80), i.e. it was close to the experimental one, which was 76mm, 155mm and 300mm.

The localized zones at failure in the beam SL20 covered 86% of its height (0.86H), while in beams SL40 and SL80: 0.773H and 0.784H, respectively. The mean cracked region height in the experiment was 0.864H (SL20), 0.816H (SL40), 0.836H (SL80), indicating a good agreement with numerical results with the small discrepancy of 6% in the beam SL40 and SL80.

                         (Eq. (16)) based on calculations in unnotched concrete beams [26]. Using the stratified sampling method (Section 4), 12 samples were solely chosen for FE numerical analyses. 
                        Fig. 21 presents one exemplary random distribution of the local tensile strength for each beams size.

In the calculations, a diagonal shear–tensile failure mechanism always occurred (as in deterministic simulations). The 12 vertical force–deflection curves from statistical calculations compared to the deterministic curve are shown in 
                        Fig. 22. The mean failure vertical forces from statistical calculations were as follows: 83.0kN (±4.0kN), 146.0kN (±6.1kN) and 234.5kN (±12.7kN) in the small-size, medium-size and large-size beams, respectively. The corresponding mean nominal shear strengths υ

                           max
                        ) were: 1.30MPa, 1.01MPa and 0.78MPa, respectively. They were solely by 9%, 13% and 11% lower than the deterministic outcomes. Thus, a statistical size effect was practically negligible that was in agreement with the theory by Bazant and Planas [22].

The statistical width of localized zones and statistical height of vertical localized zones in a constant bending moment region was similar to the deterministic values, whereas the statistical height of a critical diagonal localized zone was slightly higher than in deterministic calculations: 0.92H (small-size beam SL20), 0.87H (medium-size beam SL40) and 0.83H (large-size beam SL80), respectively. The calculated normalized position of a critical inclined localized zone d
                        c/a in all beams during statistical simulations was higher on average than in corresponding deterministic analyses and in experiments (i.e. the localized zone developed at a larger distance from the support). It was d

There exists a clear relationship between the beam bearing capacity and the position of a critical inclined localized zone from which the bond failure developed. Generally, when a critical inclined zone appeared at a larger distance from the loading point (i.e. at a smaller distance from the support), the beam bearing capacity was higher. It was, in particular, visible in large-size beams (Fig. 25) where the maximum vertical force strongly varied. The highest vertical force (Fig. 25a) was at a critical inclined localized zone at the distance of 1.28m from the loading point, and the lowest one (Fig. 25c) at the distance of 0.68m. The average spacing of vertical tensile zones in the small-size beams was s=94mm (86–105mm), in the medium-size beams s=170mm (137–198mm) and in the large-size beams s=355mm (291–463mm).

The original plastic solution for the shear failure mechanism with a diagonal crack given by Eq. (20) 
                        [64,65] assumes an inclined straight yield line starting from the support, whereas the improved plastic solution (Eqs. (21) and (22)) by Zhang [66] considers an inclined straight yield line starting at a certain distance from the support x (x=0.74D(a/D-2). The shear strengths by Nielsen and Bræstrup [64,65] and by Zhang [66], which create the upper bound of the load bearing capacity, based on the equation of the internal and external work, are calculated as follows:

                           s

The FE deterministic nominal shear strengths match very well the experimental findings and experimentally calibrated SEL curve by Bazant (with υ
                        
                           o
                        =2.87MPa and D
                        0=213mm in Eq. (1) using the Levenberg–Marquardt non-linear regression method). Both FE and experimental results lie obviously below solutions predicted by the upper bound plastic theory (Eqs. (20) and (21)) and above the lower elastic bound (υ=1). The improved plastic solution (Eq. (21)) is closer to experimental results. The upper horizontal asymptotes for small structures by Eqs. (20) and (21) are at υ=3.59MPa and υ=3.13MPa, respectively, whereas for the experimentally calibrated Eq. (1) – at υ=2.87MPa (Fig. 26).

Considering statistical simulations, all mean values underestimate the experimental shear strength by 10% on average (this result is probably caused by the assumption of a deterministic bond model in statistical computations or a sampling region limited to beam shear regions). The mean shear strength reduction in statistical computations with respect to deterministic results was close to the assumed coefficient of variation cov

                        )=2.87(1−0.12)=2.53MPa, a perfect match between the new SEL curve and the statistical results was obtained (
                        Fig. 27). Therein, the brittleness number defined by the ratio β=D/D
                        0 was not modified. This indicates that the size effect on the nominal shear strength is predominantly of a deterministic type.

With respect to FE numerical results on a size effect by Sato et al. [31], our deterministic results indicate a stronger reduction of the nominal shear strength with similar increasing beam size (38% between the small- and large-size beam against 20%).

The following conclusions can be drawn from our plane stress non-linear FE analyses with a constant and spatially correlated random distribution of the local tensile strength in geometrically similar longitudinally reinforced concrete beams without shear reinforcement failing in shear:
                        
                           •
                           An isotropic elasto-plastic constitutive model with non-local softening enhanced by a characteristic length of microstructure was able to realistically reproduce both a very complex experimental failure mode in beams (combined diagonal shear–tensile failure and horizontal bond splitting failure) and a pronounced reduction of the nominal shear strength with increasing beam size by taking a bond model into account.

The size effect on the nominal shear strength of slender RC beams without shear reinforcement was of a deterministic type only. The nominal shear strength from deterministic simulations strongly decreased with increasing specimen size. The deterministic size effect was caused by localized zones with a constant width and a linearly varying height. It was in agreement with the energetic size effect by Bazant. Thus, it was not caused by non-symmetric cracking combined with the unintended out-of-plane beam action. The mean shear strengths in statistical computations were solely lower by 10% than corresponding deterministic outcomes. The mean statistical shear strength was proportional to the mean tensile strength reduced by the standard deviation.

The effect of the bond definition between concrete and reinforcement was pronounced and led to the different failure mode, load capacity, beam stiffness and number of localized zones. The application of the bond model by Akkermann [52] contributed to a shear–diagonal tensile failure mechanism in numerical simulations as in experiments.

A position of a critical diagonal localized zone in deterministic calculations was close to experimental outcomes. In statistical calculations, a critical diagonal localized zone was located at a higher distance from the beam support, hence the mean bearing capacity was lower than the corresponding deterministic one. The height of a cracked section in experiment was successfully reproduced by both deterministic and statistical analyses. The height of a critical diagonal localized zone was slightly larger in statistical calculations than in deterministic ones. The width of localized zones was similar in deterministic and statistical calculations.
