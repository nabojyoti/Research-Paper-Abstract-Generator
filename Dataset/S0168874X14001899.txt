                  In the present work an aero-elastic model is presented to study flutter and divergence of isotropic plate wings. A finite element model is subsequently developed to apply the theoretical model and predict the performance of plate wings. A divergence analysis is carried out using the finite element model combined with the vortex lattice method for aerodynamic load calculations. The flutter analysis is carried out using a finite element model combined with the doublet lattice method. The aerodynamic model is coupled to the structural model using the shape (interpolation) functions of the finite element model. Static condensation is used to express the finite elements’ in-plane degrees of freedom in terms of the bending ones, hence reducing the number of the elements’ degrees of freedom per node to three. A MATLAB code is developed to implement the proposed model using three-node triangular finite elements. The present model is validated using benchmark problems available in the literature, and the effects of taper ratio on both divergence and flutter speeds and flutter frequency are studied.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

One of the most powerful methods used to study the behavior of structures is the finite element method. The idea of the finite element method is based on discretizing the structure into small elements in which the solution can be approximated using simple interpolation functions. All the elements are assembled together to construct a system of equations relating the loads to the degrees of freedom of the whole structure. Many researchers used the finite element method to study the aero-elastic characteristics of aircraft structures.

Cole [1] developed a model to study the divergence of wings with high aspect ratios. The results were compared with experimental data. The results showed that the divergence speed decreases with the increase of the forward sweep angle of the wing. Lee and Lee [2] performed a vibration study for composite plate wings. The wings considered in the study had different sweep back angles and taper ratios. The effect of fiber orientations was investigated. The finite element model was built using four and eight-node quadrilateral elements. The results were validated by comparison to experimental results. Shokrieh and Behrooz [3], studied the dynamic instability of a wing using NISA finite element program [4]. The purpose of this work was to ensure that the wing was safe from flutter within the wing speed range based on the Joint Aviation requirements (JAR-23) [5]. Koo [6] performed static and dynamic aero-elastic analyses for isotropic plate wings with different sweep back angles. Furthermore, he studied the effect of different double-sweep wing angles on flutter and divergence. A finite element model was used together with the doublet lattice method using the surface spline method. The effect of different fiber orientations was demonstrated. Moosavi [7] introduced a model to calculate the flutter speed for wings using Galerkin’s method. The model used the finite element method in the structural analysis and the strip theory in the aerodynamic analysis. Su and Cesnik [8] examined a flying wing aero-elastic characteristics using the finite element method. The finite element model was built using a non-linear beam model, and the 2D finite state inflow theory was used in the aerodynamic model.

Hollowell and Dugundji [9] demonstrated experimental and analytical analyses for a composite plate wing. An experimental investigation was carried out for a cantilever plate wing with different fiber orientations. The results of the analytical analysis were compared with the experimental ones and showed good agreement. An instability analysis was carried out using the V-g method [10]. Kameyama and Fukunaga [11] introduced an analysis and design for a composite plate wing using the genetic algorithm. The finite element method was used to obtain the structure stiffness matrix, and the doublet lattice method was used for the aerodynamic analysis. The instability analysis was carried out using the p–k method [12]. The results were compared with the experimental data obtained in Hollowell and Dugundji [9]. Moon [13] used multidisciplinary optimization to improve the wing divergence speed using the vortex lattice to derive the aerodynamic coefficient matrix and the finite element method to obtain the wing stiffness matrix. The wing box was approximated by an equivalent flat plate. The design objective was to minimize the aircraft weight under divergence and flutter speeds constraints. The proposed optimization model resulted in a significant improvement in the wing flutter speed. Recently, Leon [14] used aero-elastic tailoring to improve the flutter speed of a composite plate wing using topology optimization. The aero-dynamic analysis was made using the doublet lattice method, and the structural analysis was made using the finite element method. The Spline method was used to connect between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model. The V–g method was used to calculate the flutter speed. The aero-elastic stability analysis was performed using Zaero software package [15].

Patil and Hodges [16] presented a theory for the aero-elastic analysis of highly flexible flying wing aircrafts. The structural analysis is performed using beam model while the aerodynamic analysis is obtained using the 2-D aerodynamic theories. The solution of the aero-elastic equation was obtained using Newton–Raphson method. A nonlinear simulation was obtained for the flying wing aircraft. Kennedy and Martins in 2014 [17] a 3-D aero-structural optimization model. The aerodynamic analysis is obtained using a 3-D panel code while the structural analysis is performed using a finite element code. They developed a general model to connect between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model. The parallel Newton–Krylov method was used to sole the aero-structural equations. They performed an aero-structural optimization for a real wing.

The aim of this work is to study the effect of wing taper ratio on the static and dynamic instabilities of the wing. Complete structural and aerodynamic models are developed and coupled together to perform the required instability analyses. A MATLAB code is developed for the aerodynamic, finite element, and aero-elastic analysis which uses the shape function transformation to couple between the aerodynamic and the finite element models.

Two Aero-elastic models are developed to study the interaction between inertial, elastic and aerodynamic forces. There are two types of aero-elastic phenomena: The first one represents the interaction between steady aerodynamic forces and static structural elastic forces, which is known as static aero-elasticity, and the second one represents the interaction between the unsteady aerodynamic forces and the structural elastic and inertial forces, which is known as dynamic aero-elasticity (flutter).

In the aerodynamic analysis the steady and the unsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrices are developed.

There are various methods used to determine the aerodynamic forces on lifting surfaces. One of the simplest and most accurate methods is the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). In this section a steady aerodynamic model is developed for the calculation of the wing static loads needed for divergence analysis.

In the VLM, the plan-form of the wing is divided into panels (elements). Each panel is replaced by a horseshoe vortex. This horseshoe vortex has a vortex filament across the quarter-chord of the panel and two filaments stream-wise, one on each side of the panel starting at the quarter-chord and trailing downstream in the free-stream direction to infinity. 
                           Fig. 1 shows a typical horseshoe-vortex representation of a wing plan-form. The boundary condition for each horseshoe vortex is satisfied by requiring the inclination of the fluid streamline to match the angle of attack at the three-quarter-chord point of its elemental panel. The circulations required to satisfy this tangent flow boundary condition are then determined by solving a matrix equation.

                           where α is the angle of attack at the control points of the aerodynamic mesh.

We can calculate the Influence coefficient matrix by calculating the down-wash velocity at each control point by determining the relative influence of the singularities of a planar wing based on their geometric position [23] as seen in Fig. 1.

The zeroes on the diagonals correspond to the 6th degree of freedom (drilling degree of freedom) defined in Ref. [20].

To study wing flutter and divergence, one needs only the bending degrees of freedom (w,

In the present work, we study two kinds of wing instability. The first is the static instability known as divergence, and the other is the dynamic instability known as flutter. In case of divergence Eq. (10) reduces to

                        where ζ is the structural damping. Using Eq. (16), the flutter speed is obtained at zero damping. In Eq. (16), one needs to get the speed and frequency at which the flutter occurs. It is obvious that the reduced frequency k depends on the frequency omega and speed U
                        
                           inf
                        . Therefore, an iterative technique is used to find the flutter speed. This method is known as the V–g method [10], in which a range of reduced frequencies is assumed and the flow speed and structural frequency are calculated. Flutter occurs when damping vanishes. The developed model can also implement the p–k method [26] and is expected to give more accurate results [26].

For simplification, it is assumed that the unsteady aerodynamic matrices have no effect on the mass matrix and the effect on damping is negligible like in Ref. [11,14].

In this article, the aerodynamic model and the finite element model are coupled. It is desired to transform the pressure distribution from the aerodynamic model to the finite element model to predict the deformations. On the other hand, the structure deformations calculated from the finite element model affect the loads predicted by the aerodynamic model. This process goes back and forth until the “operating conditions” for the wing are reached. There are many ways which can be used to perform this coupling. Spline methods are often used [27]. In this paper, we use the interpolation (shape) functions used in the finite element model to map the aerodynamic loads to the finite element mesh.

Hence, the use of the finite element shape functions is twofold; first to integrate the pressure from the aerodynamic model to the finite element one using numerical integration, and second to transform the displacements from the finite element model to the aerodynamic one. These two functions of the interpolation functions result in the generation of two matrices GN

In the present model a liner 3-node triangular element is used. The steady aerodynamic load is obtained using the vortex lattice method, and the unsteady aerodynamic load is obtained using the doublet lattice method. The optimum number of elements was obtained for both the structure and steady and unsteady aerodynamic analyses through experimentation with the model.

To test the present model the results are compared with those obtained in reference [6]. The results are obtained for a straight isotropic wing with different sweep angles. The wing has the geometry described in 
                     Fig. 6 with thickness t of 1mm. The wing material has an elasticity modulus E of 73.8Gpa, shear modulus G of 27.6Gpa, and density rho of 2768kg/m3.


                     
                     Fig. 7 shows the finite element mesh consisting of (48) elements. The aerodynamic control points are represented by crosses. The number of the finite elements and the aerodynamic elements have been chosen based on a convergence analysis and comparison with experimental results of Ref. [6].


                     
                     Table 1 shows the divergence and flutter speeds at different sweep angles, where the positive angles represent sweep-back and the negative angles represent sweep-forward, for the present model as compared with those of Ref. [6]. It is seen that for forward-swept wings divergence occurs before flutter, and for back-ward swept wings flutter occurs before divergence. The results from the present model show reasonable agreement with the published results in Ref. [6]. The differences between both models vary with the sweep angle, and may be attributed to the following reasons. First, the present model used the vortex lattice method for steady aerodynamic analysis and the doublet lattice method for unsteady aerodynamic analysis, while in the other model the doublet point method was used for both the static and dynamic analyses. Second, the coupling between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model in the present work is performed using the finite element shape functions, which is expected to produce more accurate results compared with the infinite spline method used in Ref. [6].

The present model and the developed program are designed to analyze wings having different geometries including wings with different sweep angles and taper ratios. In this section, the effect of taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds is studied, on a straight plate wing with different taper ratios as shown in 
                     Fig. 8.


                     
                     Table 2 shows the effect of taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds and flutter frequency. The study is carried out for different taper ratios (TR), where TR=Ct/Cr, ranging from 1 (untapered wing) to 0.2 (highly tapered wing). It is clear from the results that increasing the taper (TR decreases) results in increasing the divergence speed, flutter speed and flutter frequency, which means better wing stability characteristics.

The above calculation have been repeated keeping the wing area unchanged while changing the wing taper ratio. 
                     Table 3 gives the results of study. It is seen that while the results are different from those of Table 2, they have the same trends.

A finite element model is developed to analyze the behavior of isotropic plate wings with different geometries subjected to aerodynamic loading. The developed model takes into account the aero-elastic interaction between the structural deformations and the aerodynamic loads. An accurate technique for mapping the loads calculated at the aerodynamic control points to the finite element mesh is proposed. In this technique the shape functions of the finite element model are used to perform this mapping. It is assumed that the proposed mapping is more consistent, and hence is expected to produce more accurate results as compared to other methods using simple interpolation methods. The model is customized to predict the divergence and flutter speeds of isotropic plate wings. The vortex lattice method is used for the steady aerodynamic analysis, while the doublet lattice method is used for unsteady aerodynamic analysis

The validity of the proposed model is tested by comparing the model predictions of flutter and divergence speeds for untapered wing with different sweep angles to those of other models in the literature. The results are in good agreement with some differences attributed to (1) using the vortex lattice method and the doublet lattice method in the present model as compared to the doublet point method in the other models, and (2) using the finite element shape functions to couple the aerodynamic and the finite element models as compared to the infinite spline method in other models. Both reasons suggest that the results of the present model are more accurate.

The model is also used to study the effect of the plate wing taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds. The effect of taper ratio is studied for twice; once with constant wing span Table 2, and once with constant wing area Table 3. In the first case, there are significant increase in the divergence and flutter speeds of the plate wing with the increases of the wing taper. This is consistent because the increase in wing taper decreases the area of the wing tip, which increases the stiffness of the wing that leads to the increase in the wing divergence and flutter speeds. In the second case, the divergence speed first increased and then decreased, and finally increased again, while the flutter speed decreased then increased and finally decreased again. The critical speed in this case is always the flutter speed. That is because the wing area is constant and the increase in wing taper, which decrease the wing area at the tip and increase the wing stiffness, combines with an increased in the wing span which increase the wing flexibility which may decrease the wing divergence and flutter speeds.

Assume that we have a finite element model for a structure where the total nodes are divided into constrained nodes c and free nodes f.

Applying the constrained condition on the structure, the finite element equation will take the form,
