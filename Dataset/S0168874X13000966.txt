                  In this article we present a novel application of the moving grid finite element method [1] for solving a cytomechanical model that describes actin dynamics in order to generate cell movement and deformation. The cytomechanical model describes both the mechanical and biochemical properties of the cortical network of actin filaments and its concentration. Actin is a polymer that can exist either in filamentous form (F-actin) or in monometric form (G-actin) [2] and the filamentous form is arranged in a paired helix of two protofilaments [3]. By assuming slow deformations of the cell, we validate numerical results by comparing qualitatively with predictions from linear stability theory close to bifurcation points. Far from bifurcation points, the mathematical model and computational algorithm are able to describe and generate the complex cell deformations typically observed in experiments. Our numerical results illustrate cell expansion, cell contraction, cell translation and cell relocation as well as cell protrusions. A key model bifurcation parameter identified is the contractile tonicity formed by the association of actin filaments to the myosin II motor proteins. The robustness, generality and applicability of the numerical methodology allows us to tackle similar problems in developmental biology, biomedicine and plant biology where similar mechanisms are routinely used.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The migratory behavior of cells plays a crucial role in many biological events (e.g. physiological and pathological process [4]) such as immune response [5–7], wound healing, development of tissues [8], embryogenesis [9,10], inflammation and the formation of tumor metastasis [7,11]. According to experimental observations, actin plays an important role in cell movement and deformation. Actin is a polymer that can exist in two forms; in monomeric form as G-actin or in polymeric form (i.e. in filamentous form) as F-actin [12]. The mechanical properties of actin network and the biochemical dynamics of actin (i.e. the concentration of F-actin, its random movement via diffusion, convective and dilution effects due to shape movement and its kinetics of polymerization and de-polymerization from F-actin to G-actin) inside the cell play an active role in cell movement and deformation [12–15].

In order to describe the dynamics of movements and changes in cell geometry of a eukaryotic cell we will consider a cytomechanical model that is derived based on the actin dynamics. The model is highly complex and consist of a system of nonlinear equations defined on a complex evolving geometry representing the cell. We propose to apply a novel numerical method: the moving grid finite element method (MGFEM) [1,17] to compute numerical approximate solutions of the cytomechanical model. A determining factor in choosing a numerical method is usually the ease in which a method can be applied to a problem at hand and the ability of the method to produce highly accurate solutions in comparison with other available methods. The key factors being accuracy, efficiency and robustness of the numerical method Bindu [16,17,20,25].

To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first to present the use of finite elements to solve the cytomechanical model system. To-date, numerical approximation of the cytomechanical model has been done by Alt and Tranquillo [15] and Stéphanou et al. [12] based on finite differences. Rather than working in the original cartesian coordinates, the authors transform the model system into a polar coordinate system which makes it difficulty to describe the evolution of a cell as it moves outside the origin of the polar coordinate system. The cell is not able to move or deform away from the origin [12]. The origin remains a fixed point, the cell is only able to deform along the boundary but is not able to move freely on the substrate as is observed in experiments [12]. In order to remedy this drawback, we propose to employ the MGFEM thereby enabling us to simulate accurately cell movement and deformation in complete agreement with experimental observations. Other alternative methods that could be used to overcome difficulties in solving the cytomechanical model using [18,19] finite differences include (but are not limited to) boundary element methods (BEM) [22,23] and level set methods (LSM) [24]. Since the cytomechanical model is a second order inhomogeneous and nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the application of the BEM is much more difficult compared to FEM [26]. The LSM will not be implemented here but could be implemented in the future by coupling the method to the MGFEM in order to facilitate modeling splitting and reconnecting cells. In this article, we choose to implement a finite element formulation by employing the MGFEM [1,17,29] for two advantageous reasons: (i) the MGFEM solves the model equations in their physical cartesian coordinates without the need for transformations or mappings and (ii) the MGFEM easily handles complex and evolving cellular domains. As a result, the cell is able to move and deform freely on the substrate in complete agreement with experimental observations.

In view of these key advantages, we develop a MGFEM of the cytomechanical model that is defined on a two-dimensional (2D) cartesian coordinate system. The MGFEM is a novel extension of the finite element method to moving boundary problems introduced by Madzvamuse [27] to study partial differential equations posed on complex evolving domains. The essential component underlying the MGFEM is that the object function is represented by piecewise basis functions on a finite element mesh in which the nodal positions vary with time [1,17,29]. It is a highly accurate, efficient and robust numerical method which has been used successfully to compute numerical solutions of reaction–diffusion systems on evolving and continuously deforming domains with complex geometries (see [1,17,21,28] for details). The novelty of the MGFEM is its ability to allow the prescription of the nodal displacement of the computational grid points of the finite element mesh during the evolution of the domain. It is able to accommodate a priori description of the grid displacement [27], a computed grid displacement (which are solutions of a partial differential equation of an unknown variable) or a grid displacement generated by minimizing the residual of the differential equation [29,30] (as developed by [30] in the moving finite element). The difference between the moving finite element and MGFEM is the derivation of the grid displacement [21].

Therefore, this article is structured as follows: In Section 2 we present the cytomechanical model. In Section 3 we derive the weak formulation for the cytomechanical model and then present the finite element discretization of the model system. We also describe the method of computation of the domain evolution and the techniques of implementation of the MGFEM. Since the cytomechanical model is a highly complex nonlinear system of partial differential equations, analytical solutions in closed form can not be derived. To this end, it is difficult to compare numerical solutions to exact analytical solutions. Therefore, in order to validate numerical results, we call upon linear stability theory and show that close to bifurcation points, the numerical method computes solutions in close agreement with those predicted by linear theory. Details of linear stability theory are presented in Appendix B. Linear theory also provides us with plausible ranges for the parameter values. Once validated, numerical results obtained from the implementation of the MGFEM are shown in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we conclude and discuss future research strands.

                      is used here to specify the differences in pressure in the cell at the vicinity of the membrane and further away from it. We have assumed that the polymerization of actin, which happens predominately at the vicinity of the membrane, induces a pressure that reinforces the osmotic pressure at the vicinity of the membrane. Eq. (2.1b) describes the conservation of F-actin within the cell. It describes the concentration of F-actin, its random movement via diffusion, convective and dilution effects due to the movement of the cell and its kinetics of polymerization and depolymerization.

                        u
                      is the displacement of the actin network at any given point in space and is computed as the displacement solution obtained from the force balance equation (2.1a). In the interior of the domain, we assume that 
                        β
                        =
                        ∂

                      where 
                        ∂
                        x
                        /

                      is the mesh velocity. Thus we have a Lagrangian description of the domain evolution.

For initial conditions, we define the initial domain 
                        
                           
                              Ω
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                     , t=0, to be a unit disk. We prescribe the initial conditions for F-actin density a
                     0 to correspond to random small perturbations around the homogeneous steady state of the cell. This state biologically corresponds to the cell condition right after mitosis (i.e. cell division) with the cell having a perfectly circular shape. The steady state of F-actin is assumed to occur as a result of an equilibrium in the kinetics of polymerization/depolymerization of actin within the cell and there is no flux of actin from the exterior. We assume that at the initial time, the cell is unstrained from its original position. The boundary conditions in (2.1f) specify a zero flux boundary for the reaction–diffusion equation (2.1b) and a stress free boundary for the force balance equation (2.1a).
                        Remark 2.1
                        We note that in a previous work by Stéphanou et al. [12], the displacement

                            was taken to be the displacement of the elements of the actin network from the original unstrained position. In this work, we compute the displacement 
                              u
                              (

                              x
                              ∈
                              
                                 
                                    Ω

                           . An advantage of this modification is that the cell is no longer rigid but can translate, expand and contract.

                      to be larger than that of the shear modulus. This is because F-actin are more resistant to compression than shear [33]. The rest of the dimensional model parameter values are shown in Table 1
                     . It must be noted that we have not assigned parameter values for pressure coefficient p and the contractile coefficient

The essential component underlying the moving grid finite element method (MGFEM) is that the object function is represented by piecewise basis functions on a finite element mesh in which the nodal positions vary with time [1,17,29]. The way in which these nodes are moved and how the solution evolves is derived in the weak form of the model system. Unlike previous studies [1,17] where the nodal movement was provided by a separate definition, here nodal movement is an unknown quantity to be computed simultaneously with the actin concentrations. The MGFEM is an extension of the finite element method to moving boundary problems. Thus from Sections 3.1–3.80, we describe the finite element discretization of the coupled system (2.1) defined on a moving cell and in Section 3.9, we present the method for the cell domain evolution. We note that the MGFEM applied to reaction–diffusion equations has already been established [21] but this is not the case for the force balance equation. Our aim is to present in detail the MGFEM applied to the cytomechanical model by deriving a MGFEM of the force balance equation and then couple it to that of the reaction–diffusion equation.

                     Substituting the matrix tensor representation of the stress tensors into (2.1a) we obtain the force balance equation in matrix tensor form which is then decoupled into a system of two equations. The decoupled system of differential equations of the force balance equation is thus

                           Remark 3.1
                           We would like to note that we do not actually compute the derivatives of the delta function but we transfer these derivatives to the test function by using identities (3.5).

First let us approximate the continuously evolving cell domain with a finite polygonal domain as follows: at each time t,

Each triangular partition is known as an element S and the set of these finite triangular elements is called a mesh and we denote this mesh by

                        . For the finite element mesh we require that no vertex of any element lie on the interior of a side of another element and

In order to obtain a fully discrete finite element model of the coupled problem, we consider a modified implicit finite differentiation formula for the time integration of the semi-discrete finite element model of the force balance equation and the reaction–diffusion equation as given in (3.19) and (3.20) respectively. Thus the fully discrete finite element model of the coupled problem is given by

                        , we assemble the finite elements to obtain the system of linear algebraic (3.21). This system (3.21a) is solved using a generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) [38] while that of (3.21b) is solved using a conjugate gradient method (CG) with diagonal pre-conditioner [39,40].

In order to track the evolution of the domain accurately, we specify a Lagrangian kinematic description of the domain. We assume that the displacement of the boundary of the domain occurs only in the direction that is normal to its non-deformed position. The displacement of the domain boundary at any time t corresponds to the solutions of the force balance equation

                         at any particular space and time. The displacement of the interior nodes of the mesh is chosen to be equal to the flow velocity 
                           β

                        ). On the boundary we assume that

                           =

                           t
                        , where 
                           W
                         is the displacement solution of the force balance equation.

A limitation of the Lagrangian kinematic description is that the minimum angle condition for the mesh elements can be violated for non-constant mesh velocity and large mesh velocity. A remedy is to introduce a monitor function to check the quality of the mesh (say after a couple of mesh movements) and re-mesh when the elements are no longer favourable. It must be noted that re-meshing will introduce interpolation errors. In our case, the displacement solutions of the force balance equation are small in value hence the mesh velocity is small. For the time interval we considered, no mesh refinement was required. Developing adaptive time- and mesh-refinement strategies form part of our current studies for these types of models.

                      the domain evolution is negligible and based on this assumption we are able to compare the finite element solutions to predictions from linear stability theory. The perturbations used in the initial conditions will be dependent on the eigenmode we seek to excite. We subsequently show that the finite element scheme gives numerical results that are consistent with those predicted by linear stability theory.

                            is allowed to vary while all other parameters value are fixed (see Table B4 for possible values of

                            and the displacement solutions showing the excitation of mixed and higher modes respectively. We present in Table 2

                              ψ
                            used in the numerical simulations. A comparison of the predicted solutions from linear theory (Fig. 3(a) and (d)) with the numerical results (Fig. 3(b), (c) and (e), (f)) show that the numerical scheme reproduces results in close agreement to those predicted by linear stability theory for the mixed and higher modes for the actin concentration.

Now that we have validated our numerical results by use of linear stability theory close to bifurcation points, we are in position to illustrate the robustness and applicability of the numerical method. By choosing appropriate model parameter values far away from bifurcation points, cell expansion and contraction (uniform) can be observed as well as non-uniform cell deformation as illustrated in the next.

The simulation results showing the actin concentration solutions with uniform expansions are shown in Fig. 5

                                 , we observe cell deformations which agree qualitatively to those observed experimentally [41]. It can be observed that actin concentration is high at the periphery of the cell boundary and is highest at regions were protrusions occur. In Fig. 8
                                 , we present the graphical display of the simulation results of the actin concentration. A plot of the index of polarity against the number of time-steps taken is given in Fig. 8(g). We can infer from these results that the dynamics of the cell domain, the distribution of actin filaments are related to the pressure coefficient p and the contractile tonicity

The distribution of F-actin in cells has been well studied and epifluorescence images are available in the literature. Fig. 9
                           (a) shows an epifluorescence image of a Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cell obtained from [41]. The fibroblast was stained by the authors for F-actin after being allowed to spread for 1h. The epifluorescence image shows that F-actin is predominant at the cell periphery and is highest at the regions were protrusions occur. The simulation results presented in Fig. 9(b) are thus consistent with the experimental observations.

                              Key model parameters


                              Based on the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation results we are able to identify key parameters that control cell deformations with respect to the model problem. The contractile tonicity 
                                    ψ
                                  is the bifurcation parameter and determines the transition from stable to unstable state. The actin saturation concentration a

                                  and the pressure coefficient were also found to play a key role in cell deformations.

Here we choose parameters for the cell such that they are consistent with those available in the literature such that Young's modulus E of the actin filament is 4000dyn/cm2

Understanding cell movement and deformation in cell motility, developmental biology and biomedical engineering promises to unearth new research strands currently unchartered. In many cases, the models derived are highly complex and nonlinear with no closed form analytical solutions. Furthermore, growth evolution (cell membrane movement and deformation) is an added parameter that makes it even more difficult to treat the models analytically. It remains therefore, to propose and develop novel numerical methods capable of providing approximate solutions. The numerical method should be robust, efficient, and should be able to deal easily with domain and surface evolution. In this article, we proposed the moving grid finite element method [1] to numerically compute solutions to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing cell movement and deformation. Our main contributions are:
                        
                           •
                           a novel application of the MGFEM to solve a cytomechanical model that allows cells to move and deform arbitrarily.

by using linear stability theory close to bifurcation points, we validated numerical results where linear solutions are analytically derived.

far away from bifurcation points, we generate and observe complex cell deformations typically observed in experiments. Our numerical results show cell expansion, cell contraction, cell translation and relocation and cell protrusions.

the contractile tonicity formed by the association of actin filaments to the myosin II motor proteins and the pressure coefficient are identified as key model bifurcation parameters of the model.

                      given in (3.18). The exact normals of a unit circle can be calculated analytically and are known [46]. As the number of boundary nodes increases (via global refinement of the mesh) the mesh height h decreases and we show in Table A1
                      that the numerically computed unit normals converges to the exact normal of a unit circle.

At the intersection of two line segments (i.e. at a nodal position). The resultant normal n is computed by applying the parallelogram law of forces (see Fig. A1
                     ).

In Table A1 we show that the computed normals converge to the exact normal in the L
                     2 norm as the number of mesh points increases. The mesh with no global refinement corresponds to a macro triangulation having 4 line segments that form a diamond shape. The mesh with 1, 2, 3 global refinements of the macro triangulation have polygonal boundaries that comprises of 8, 16 and 32 line segments. We note that we have incorporated nodal projection of boundary nodes during mesh refinements so that the resulting mesh approximates the unit circle better as the number of global refinement increases.

Here we present linear stability analysis of the cytomechanical model. Specific details of linear stability theory can be found in [31]. The primary purpose of linear stability theory in this article are two fold: (i) to present linear solutions that validate numerical solutions around bifurcation points and (ii) to determine mathematically plausible parameter values for the pressure coefficient p and the contractile coefficient 
                        ψ
                      that will give rise to cell deformation. To proceed, we first non-dimensionalize the system of equations in order to reduce the number of parameters making the mathematical analysis afterwards more amendable.

The wavenumber k
                        2 are discrete. In Table B4
                        , we give the values of 
                           ψ
                         required by the dispersion relation to isolate a couple of wavenumbers. In Fig. B1
                         we show possible single and mixed modes that could evolve for bands of wavenumbers given in Table B4.

Here we keep all parameters given in Table B1 fixed except the pressure coefficient
