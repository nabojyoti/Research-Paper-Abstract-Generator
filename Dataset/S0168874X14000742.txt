                  Prediction of shear band formation and other strain localization processes presents many computational challenges that must be overcome to enable dynamic failure prediction and material design of ductile material systems. The current work presents a finite element based computational framework accounting for this critical deformation process, as applied to a detailed investigation of friction stir welded (FSW) aluminum joints. A stir welded joint has several zones, each with distinct microstructural characteristics and material properties. For applications in Army land vehicles, which may be subject to under-body blast, an understanding of the energy absorption capability of these joints is needed. Thus material inhomogeneity, dynamic loading, and detailed understanding of small scale failure processes must all be accounted for to accurately model FSW material behavior. In this study, an implicit nonlinear consistent (INC) or monolithic solution technique is used to predict shear band formation and estimate the energy absorption and failure strain of a stir welded aluminum joint. It has been shown that failure initiating at material interface regions can be predicted, and furthermore that abrupt material property gradients predominantly contribute to FSW joint failure.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

High strength lightweight aluminum alloys offer potential advantages as replacements for traditional steels in many Army vehicles in terms of weight specific mechanical properties. Unibody chassis construction, as opposed to body on frame construction, is being pursued to lend enhanced rigidity to maintain structural integrity during potential under-body blast events. Since unibody construction requires the elimination of bolted joints, weldability of the chassis material is crucial. Alloys from the aluminum 2XXX and 5XXX series are notoriously difficult to weld with conventional techniques, but can be joined with Friction Stir Welding (FSW) [1].

FSW is a solid state joining process, which has recently been shown to be capable of producing joints in aluminum up to 76.2mm thick [2,3]. The FSW tool consists mainly of a shank, shoulder, and pin (shown in Fig. 1
                     ), which rotate as they advance, stirring the material together. Significant inelastic deformation, heat production, and dynamic recrystallization occur during this process, which results in the formation of several zones with distinct microstructure and material properties [4–9].


                     Fig. 2
                      shows a cross-section of a typical FSW joint, in this case 2139 Aluminum, which illustrates the nature of these distinct material zones. The material zone most immediately surrounding the high-torque tool pin, inserted between the welded plates, is characterized by an upper and a lower weld nugget. The upper and lower weld nuggets are zones B and A, respectively, in Fig. 2. This comes as a direct influence of the tool pin on the material grain structure as well as the thermal properties of the material and recrystallization processes. The tool shoulder creates a great deal of friction in contact with the plate surface during the FSW process which generates an inordinate amount of heat in comparison to the bottom of the plate [10]. The difference in thermal inputs and boundary conditions thus creates a through thickness variation in recrystallization and grain growth which leads to the distinct lower and upper weld nuggets, marked as zones A and B, respectively in Fig. 2. Note that for thin welds there is no readily discernible difference between the upper and lower nuggets; however, welds of, at least 2cm thick are of the greatest interest for Army land vehicle applications. At this thickness there is a clear distinction between the upper and lower nuggets, as shown in [11,12]; just outside of the weld nugget, zone C in Fig. 2, is a third material zone which is still subject to both the mechanical and the thermal influence of the FSW stirring pin. Further from the tool is a fourth material zone, too distant to be influenced by mechanical stirring, but still subject to thermal microstructural effects as heat is conducted away from the FSW joint during processing. This is known as the thermal affected zone and is marked by zone D in Fig. 2. The importance of accounting for these variations must be noted, and they will play a significant role in the simulations below. Computational modeling of the FSW process, aimed at numerically predicting the FSW joint zones, has been carried out by [13–15] on joints 6.35mm thick and by [16–18] on joint 7mm thick. Additional computational studies by [19,20] sought to determine how the FSW process parameters such as tool advancement speed affect the final weld. The studies cited above used either a Lagrangian or an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) type of numerical formulation with adaptive remeshing. However, Eulerian formulations are also available [21].

In this study, we numerically model high rate loading of a small cross section of a stir welded joint. The goal is to develop a predictive capacity for energy absorption and failure of FSW joints in dynamic loading, as well as to gain an understanding of the relationship between an FSW joint microstructure and the resulting energy absorption capability and failure strain. It is found that the presence of the abruptly changing material zones leads to significantly reduced energy absorption capacity of the FSW joint in comparison to two benchmark tests with uniform material properties. The benchmarks used the material properties of the unaffected material and the lower nugget, the nominally weakest of the weld zones. This suggests that weld capacity can be improved by altering the FSW process parameters such that the final weld contains more smoothly varying zones.

Preliminary formulations showing reliable, mesh insensitive results for shear bands have been studied at small strains in [22]. The governing equations considering small strain deformation are as follows:

The function g is the inelastic constitutive law, which hardens with increasing plastic strain and strain rate, and softens with temperature. Note that an additive split of the deformation rate into elastic, inelastic and thermal parts has been used. A J2 plasticity model has been employed; the inelastic constitutive relation thus depends on the Von Mises stress

The PDE model was discretized in a mixed finite element framework with a monolithic nonlinear solution scheme, where all four of the unknown fields above are updated simultaneously. The discretization and time marching scheme can be found in [22]. We define the weak form residual of the system as

                      is the solution field. Here, u is the displacement, 
                        σ
                      the stress, T the temperature and γ

It is important to note that at each time step, Newton iterations are performed until convergence, in contrast to split solution schemes [24–27], where the solution is updated with one way coupling. Thus, given some approximation to p at time step n+1 and Newton iteration

                      the stiffness matrices arising from linear material behavior, and 
                        G
                      the matrices arising from nonlinear material behavior. Note that the Jacobian is not symmetric, and indicates strong coupling between equations as plasticity is initiated and the shear band forms.

This model incorporates two key aspects of successful shear band modeling: the use of thermal diffusion as a regularization parameter, and the use of a monolithic nonlinear solver to eliminate splitting errors at every time step. Thermal diffusion acts as a localization limiter, implicitly defining the width of the shear band. Without diffusion, the only localization limiter is the mesh size, leading to artificial shear bandwidths. Thus, introduction of a length scale via thermal diffusion in the governing equations leads to mesh independence and reliable solutions. Even with diffusion, the use of a monolithic nonlinear solver was found to drastically reduce the resolution necessary to obtain converged results. A split scheme strictly speaking is mesh insensitive if diffusion is included, and converges to the same result as the monolithic scheme in the limit of infinitesimal time step. However, in practice, it is found to exhibit unreasonably slow convergence with finite time steps and mesh sizes as shown in Fig. 3
                     . This is due to the fact that shear band constitutive models are strongly coupled and very sensitive to the small errors which occur due to operator splitting.

An additional relevant development shown in [22] is the use of the Pian–Sumihara stress interpolants [30], which can be shown to be locking free for large nearly incompressible deformations (which is the case in shear bands). The use of these interpolants is shown to lead to increased convergence rate and decreased computational cost in comparison to irreducible interpolations on the same mesh.

This monolithic formulation for predicting strain localization effects is adapted to a finite element model of an FSW joint that accounts for the distinct material properties unique to each material zone formed during the welding process. The characteristic dynamic load cases are simulated and then evaluated in terms of stress–strain response and energy absorption capacity.

A symmetric model of the FSW joint has been created, as seen in Fig. 4
                     , which also shows the loading configurations tested. The model accounts for property variations in each FSW zone as shown in Table 1
                     . These parameters were fit from the experimental data by [11,12]. The stir weld process involves extensive inelastic deformation as well as dynamic recrystallization in the upper weld nugget. Due to the recrystallization, the grain size in the upper nugget is larger than that of the lower nugget. However, contrary to expectation given the grain size in the respective regions, the experimental data show that the upper weld nugget has a higher yield strength than the lower weld nugget. It is suspected that the reason for this is a higher dislocation density in the upper nugget [31]. At present, transmission electron microscopy which could confirm this hypothesis is not available, but this is not crucial to the numerical results presented here (Tables 2 and 3
                     
                     ).

The 5mm by 5mm region represents a submodel focused on the key region of interest with the greatest property mismatches and potential for failure initiation. Dynamic loading using a velocity boundary condition was employed to simulate the major components of a blast event, i.e. in-plane tension, through-thickness compression, and transverse shear, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Two loading rates of 1E3s−1 and 1E4s−1 were investigated. By way of comparison to the actual FSW material configuration (referred to as “SW” in all results to follow), a region of uniform monolithic untreated aluminum material was tested (referred to as “UA”). Further, as the lower weld nugget possesses the nominally weakest material properties of the FSW joint, a test case investigating a region of uniform aluminum with lower weld nugget properties was investigated (referred to as “LN”). The purpose of this is to further gage the effect of non-uniformity in the material properties of the weld joint on the energy absorption.

Following the experimental work of Marchand and Duffy [32], shear band formation occurs in three stages. Stage 1 consists of homogeneous deformations, and includes the linear elastic range, yielding point, and the inelastic strain hardening range. Stage 2 occurs after the stress has passed through a peak, leading to initial strain softening that corresponds to localized deformations, and is often referred to as localization. Stage 3, also known as stress collapse, is marked by significant strain softening and precipitous drop in the load carrying capability of the material, leading to strong localization and intense plastic deformation associated with shear bands. Note that it is possible for Stage 3 deformations to develop at a material point or neighborhood of material points while the joint has reserve capacity. It is very difficult to rigorously distinguish between Stage 2 and Stage 3 deformations. Investigations on mathematical stability conditions for shear band models such as [33–36] generally do not coincide with Stage 3 deformations since instability is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for severe localization. On the other hand, it has been observed by [37] that shear bands grow rapidly after a 90% reduction in stress. Thus, this is a reasonable criterion for shear band initiation at a material point. Since our main concern here is the energy absorption capacity of the joint as a whole, we define global failure when

                      drops below 90% of its peak value, which indicates that the material has lost significant ability to dissipate energy. The capacity of the material is then defined as 
                        W
                      at failure. Since 
                        
                           
                              W

                      is a volume averaged quantity, it represents a global failure criterion. It is also of interest to identify from which weld zone or zone interface failure originates. For this purpose, identification of Stage 3 deformations as a local failure criterion is also useful. In the results below, this information is tabulated showing the nominal strain and

Results of the cross weld tension simulations (see Fig. 4(a)) at two different strain rates are shown in Figs. 5 and 6
                        
                        . Fig. 5 shows characteristic contour plots of equivalent plastic strain at the time of failure, and Von Mises stress at the time of peak

                        . Contour plots are shown side by side for a uniform region of untreated aluminum followed by a plot of the simulated weld zone region in Fig. 5. The shear band pattern for the UA and SW cases is clearly different, with the shear band in the SW case being contained entirely in zones 1 and 2. For the stir weld case, yielding is first observed in the zone 2, which corresponds to the lower weld nugget. Localization is also first observed in this zone, but shear band initiation, as indicated by a precipitous drop in the local stress level during loading, originates from the upper weld nugget. This behavior is observed for both loading rates in the numerical simulation. Quasi-static experiments on FSW samples reported in [11,12] showed that the failure origin zone would be determined by which zone reaches strain hardening saturation first, which was found to be the LN. Herein we have matched these baseline quasi-static behaviors and extrapolated both to higher strain rates and a greater number of loading conditions. The dynamic case is somewhat more complicated, with rate effects and thermal softening being present. Strain hardening saturation is not an adequate indicator for failure because strain softening and localization do not necessarily imply failure, which has been noted in the experimental work of Marchand and Duffy [32], and is evident in the numerical results presented here. The nominal strain to failure, strain energy at failure, and the zone in which failure initiates are shown in Table 4
                        .

Perhaps the most important feature of Fig. 5 is the buildup of stresses that occur near the material zone boundary. This is essentially an interfacial stress directly due to the material inhomogeneity and the property mismatch, which leads to failure of the SW joint at lower strains compared to the unaffected aluminum. This effect leads to significant differences in the overall stress strain response of the joint, which is shown in Fig. 6, where the domain averaged stress σ
                        22 is plotted against the nominal strain. The oscillations present in these plots are due to elastic wave reflections, which are damped quickly by plastic deformation. This illustrates that in an averaged sense, the FSW joint is marginally stronger than the lower weld nugget, but at the cost of significant ductility, failing at less than half the nominal strain of the untreated aluminum. The loss of mechanical capacity of the weld can clearly be seen in comparing the FSW weld performance (SW) to that of unwelded aluminum (UA) in Fig. 7
                        . The FSW joint fails at approximately five times lower mechanical energy for the strain rate of 1E3s−1 and three times lower for the rate of 1E4s−1, due to both softening (and lower initial rate of strain energy) and a lower strain capacity before failure initiation, see Table 4. Though thermo-mechanical property degradation due to FSW processing clearly weakens the FSW joint strength, it is readily apparent that inhomogeneity of the joint and interfacial stress risers are the key drivers for loss of mechanical capacity. This is evidenced by the fact that if the entire region were composed of the nominally weakest material of the lower weld nugget, this would still outperform the actual FSW. This comparison is clearly seen in Fig. 7, in which the rate of strain energy is comparable, yet the duration of significant energy absorption prior to failure is much larger for monolithic LN material as compared to the actual FSW joint. The reduction in energy absorption at the strain rate of 1E3s−1 is greater than the reduction at the strain rate 1E4s−1. This indicates that the effect of material inhomogeneity decreases with increasing strain rate. This is due to the fact that the material zones have the same rate hardening characteristics, which become increasingly prevalent relative to the inhomogeneous strain hardening characteristics as the applied strain rate increases (Fig. 8
                        ).

The through-thickness compression test cases, illustrated in Fig. 4(b), again evidence the distinctive features of strain localization and shear band formation. The exact morphology of the shear bands and the resulting stress field are quite different for this different loading case. As was observed for the cross weld tension case, yielding and localization are first observed in the LN of the stir weld. Additionally, the trend that increasing the strain rate slightly mitigates the loss in energy absorption is also observed. However, in the compression test, failure originates from the point where the UN, LN, and TMAZ meet. Despite these differences, the trends shown in the stress strain curves in Fig. 9
                         are very similar to that of the tensile case, where the FSW experiences a significant loss of ductility due to stress risers at the material interfaces. The traces of rate of strain energy in Fig. 10
                         are also relatively similar, likely due to the fact that both loading cases are driven by normal strains as applied at the macro-level. More quantitatively, Table 5
                         shows that while a significant reduction occurs in both the strain to failure and the energy capacity, the reduction is not as severe as it was in the cross weld tension case.

The FSW geometry is asymmetric, and therefore two cases of “clockwise” and “counterclockwise” shear loading have been investigated. Both clockwise and counterclockwise cases produce very similar results both qualitatively and quantitatively, so only the clockwise shear case is shown. Here, we observe that the strength reduction due to the weld zones is much smaller than the normal loading cases, see Table 6
                        . This is due to the loading conditions producing high stress concentrations on the upper and lower left corners of the weld, which are not adjacent to any material interface. The stress concentrations produced at the material interfaces are thus less significant than those produced due to the loading configuration; note the similar Von Mises stress contour in Fig. 11
                        . In other words, we observe a failure which is localized within a specific zone, in contrast to the normal loading cases where failure involved strong interaction between zones resulting in failure initiation at the zone interface. This is further evidenced by the shear stress response shown in Fig. 13 and the rate of strain energy plot in Fig. 12
                        . The overall trends of the normal loading cases are reproduced, but the final results are much less drastic, with a slight reduction in capacity being present for the FSW joint. 
                     

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

We have investigated a Friction Stir Welded (FSW) joint under various high strain rate loading conditions using a thermal softening, rate dependent plasticity model. The model accounts for thermal diffusion which regularizes the problem in the softening region and is solved using a monolithic (also known as implicit nonlinearly consistent, or simultaneous) nonlinear solver. As a benchmark, the loading cases were also run with the uniform material properties of the untreated aluminum (UA), and of the lower weld nugget (LN), which is nominally the weakest constituent of a FSW joint. Calculation of the strain to failure and strain energy at failure shows decreased ductility and energy absorption capacity for FSW joint in comparison to the UA and LN cases. This is due to the mismatch of inelastic material properties, namely the yield stress and hardening properties of the material zones. Such a mismatch leads to stress risers which cause early failure.

It was found that early failure of the stir welded joint is primarily caused by stress concentrations at material zone interfaces, suggesting the importance of adapting manufacturing methods to minimize abrupt property changes. Two factors were found to mitigate the effect of the material mismatch, the first of which was increasing the strain rate. Since this leads to an increased prevalence on strain rate hardening, which is the same for all weld zones, the mismatch caused by the different strain hardening properties was less apparent. The second factor was the loading configuration. In the shear tests, large stress concentrations were produced by the loading conditions within a zone locally and not near a material interface. This leads to a failure which was localized to a zone, where again the material mismatch was less apparent.

Quasi-static experiments have identified the lower weld nugget as the typical zone of failure origin in the stir weld. In contrast, the present dynamic analysis shows that the early failure of the stir welded joint is primarily caused by the stress risers at the material interfaces, and not due to a single weld zone behaving as a weak link. This presents a key point of the current analysis and immediately suggests that FSW joint strength can be improved by minimization of interfacial stresses, which could theoretically be achieved through a variety of process modifications, alleviation of abrupt property changes, and introduction of greater functional gradients within the material.
