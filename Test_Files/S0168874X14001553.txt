                  A modified interval parameter perturbation finite element method (MIPPM) and a reliability-based optimization model are proposed for the coupled structural-acoustic field prediction and structural design with uncertainties in both the physical parameters and boundary conditions. Interval variables are used to quantitatively describe all the uncertain parameters with limited information. The interval matrix and vector are expanded by the modified Taylor series. Compared with the traditional perturbation method, the proposed MIPPM can yield more accurate ranges of the uncertain structural-acoustic field, in which the higher order terms of Neumann series are employed to approximate the interval matrix inverse. The reliability idea is introduced to establish an interval optimization model relying on the satisfaction degree of interval. The uncertain constraints can be transformed into deterministic ones if given the confidence level. The proposed MIPPM is used to predict the intervals of the constraints, and whereby eliminate the optimization nesting. Numerical results about a 3D car are given to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In recent years, with the increase of people׳s awareness of environment and requirement for comfort, research on acoustic behavior inside the cabin is becoming a challenging problem for the lager complex structures such as cars, boats and airplanes. Therefore, predicting and improving the acoustic performance in terms of numerical simulation at the design stage has a very important significance. In many engineering situations, the noise induced by the coupling between the fluid and the structure is often encountered. The coupled structural-acoustic problem incorporates the mutual influence between the thin structure and acoustic field when the feedback of the acoustic fluid on the structure cannot be ignored [1]. The analytical solutions of the coupled structural-acoustic problem exist only for the simple shapes, while for the real-life problem, the numerical techniques become more practical, which can be grouped into two categories: deterministic approaches [2–4] and statistical analysis [5]. The deterministic approaches, such as the finite element method (FEM), boundary element method (BEM) and infinite element method (IEM), are concentrated towards the structural and acoustic response in the low-frequency range. In the high-frequency range, the response is very sensitive to small changes in the model, and thus the statistical energy analysis (SEA), introduced by Lyon and Maidanik in the 1960s [6], places great emphasis on the high-frequency response analysis by using time and space statistical information. In the last two decades, design of structural and acoustic systems that reduces noise and vibration through optimization has become very important. Hinton and Rao [7] applied shape optimization techniques to obtain optimal shell geometry and thickness distribution with the objective of a maximized fundamental frequency of structures. Marburg [8] described the noise transfer function including structural harmonic analysis, acoustic influence coefficients and their coupling, and proposed the well-known semianalytic calculation of harmonic displacement sensitivities. In the literature [9], a topology optimization based approach was proposed to study the optimal configuration of stiffeners for the interior sound reduction.

Traditional acoustic analysis has been conducted under the assumption that the physical properties and boundary conditions are deterministic. But in the actual engineering, due to the model inaccuracies, physical imperfections and system complexities, uncertainties in material properties, geometric dimensions and boundary conditions are unavoidable, which will lead to the uncertainty of the acoustic field. Popular approaches for these uncertain problems are probabilistic methods, where the probability density functions are defined unambiguously. Allen and Vlahopoulos [10] combined boundary element methods and finite element methods with stochastic analysis to calculate noise radiated from a structure subjected to random excitation. Chen et al. [11] developed the computing technique for the acoustic pressure spectral density and its sensitivity of coupled structural–acoustic systems subjected to stochastic excitation. James and Dowling [12,13] investigated the methods to quantify the uncertainties to determine the probability density functions of the sound pressure amplitude in the acoustic domain. For the probabilistic methods, a great amount of statistical information is required to construct the precise probability distribution functions of uncertain parameters. Unfortunately, for many engineering problems, it is often too difficult or costly to collect enough information about the uncertainty.

In order to overcome the shortcomings of probabilistic methods, some non-probabilistic approaches such as convex model and interval analysis have achieved widespread attention to deal with the uncertain problems without sufficient information [14,15]. Neumaier [16] investigated the hypercube approximation for the united solution set of the interval equations by the Gaussian elimination scheme, which will be extremely conservative due to a large number of elimination operations [17]. If the monotonicity of function was guaranteed, the exact response intervals can be obtained by the vertex method using all possible combinations of the interval parameters [18]. However, the computational effort of this method increases exponentially with the increase in the number of uncertain parameters. Compared with above interval approaches, the interval perturbation finite element method, proposed by Qiu et al. [19,20], has been widely applied in the structural response analysis thanks to its simplicity and efficiency [21]. On this basis, Xia and Yu developed the interval and subinterval perturbation methods to predict the acoustic field with uncertain-but-bounded parameters [22,23]. Up to now, research on interval uncertain problems is mainly concentrated in the structural field, while the application of interval approaches in the acoustic domain is still unexplored enough [24].

Hence, establishing effective numerical methods and optimization models for the structural-acoustic system with interval parameters has great significance both in theory and engineering. Firstly, finite element equations suitable to coupled structural-acoustic system are briefly presented. Subsequently in the next section, considering higher order terms, a modified parameter perturbation method is proposed to approximately predict the response intervals in the frequency domain. In Section 4, the new model and algorithm of interval reliability optimization are proposed based on the satisfaction degree of interval. A 3D car numerical example is given for verification in Section 5, and we conclude the paper with a brief discussion at last.

For the interior acoustic field bounded by Γ, boundary conditions are usually grouped into three sets: the Dirichlet condition, Neumann condition and Robin condition.

Due to the limitations of production and measurement error, uncertainties in acoustic medium, material properties and applied loads are all taken into account. In this paper, the uncertainties whose lower and upper bounds can be determined by the limited information are quantitatively described as the interval parameters and assumed to belong to an uncertain-but-bounded parameter vector as follows

As we know, the first-order Taylor expansion for the linear function is accurate. Its accuracy for the non-linear function is also acceptable if the ranges of the interval parameters are narrow enough. However, the interval expansion problem becomes so serious that the accuracy is not acceptable if the interval parameters are not narrow enough or a large number of uncertain parameters exist. Based on the work of Chen et al. [26], in this section we will present a modified Taylor expansion and a modified parameter perturbation method where higher order terms are retained.

Compared with FIPPM where only first-order terms are considered, it is obvious that the interval matrix inverse in MIPPM is calculated by retaining part of higher order terms in Neumann series. Therefore, the proposed MIPPM can obtain more accurate response bounds, and it provides a powerful tool for the interval reliability optimization in the next section.

The core concept of reliability represents a probability by which a component part, equipment, or system will satisfactorily perform its intended function under given circumstances [27]. In the traditional probabilistic reliability, the quality function Y is considered as a random variable with respect to the random uncertain parameters

It is well-known that large structures such as cars, boats and airplanes have strict requirements of acoustic behaviors inside the cabin. Traditional acoustic optimizations have been carried out on the premise that system parameters were treated as deterministic values, and the general optimization model can be formulated as follows

Considering the unavoidable uncertainties in the optimization problem, some constraints are made to be satisfied with a predetermined confidence level and the uncertain constraints are transformed into the deterministic ones [29]. Therefore, the following uncertain optimization model will be yielded if given the confidence level

                        I
                     , the original reliability-based optimization problem is transformed into a nested optimization model by using the satisfaction degree as shown in Eq. (45) to represent the non-probabilistic reliability. The outer-layer optimization is used to capture the optimal values of design variables, while the aim of inner-layer optimization is to predict the upper and lower bounds of interval constraints as shown in Eq. (46). Based on the proposed MIPPM, the response ranges can be quickly obtained and meanwhile the tedious inner-layer optimization can be avoided. Therefore, the nested optimization problem is converted into a conventional single-layer one, greatly improving the efficiency of optimization calculation.

Consider a complex coupled structural-acoustic system of a 3D car model as shown in 
                     Fig. 3. The structure and acoustic cavity are discretized by 710 quadrilateral elements and 2150 hexahedral elements, respectively. A unit normal harmonic excitation is imposed on the central point at the roof, and the remaining vertices are set to be fixed. Considering the unpredictability of the environment temperature, the density of air and the acoustic speed surrounding the acoustic cavity are treated as uncertain-but-bounded parameters. The density of air ranges from 1.125kg/m3–1.325kg/m3, and the acoustic speed ranges from 330m/s–350m/s. Besides the fluid medium, the properties of different structural materials are listed in 
                     Table 1. Due to the material heterogeneity and measurement error, the structural material properties are all uncertain and supposed to have a 5% perturbation nearby their normal values. The amplitude of the harmonic excitation fluctuates between 0.95N and 1.05N.

Simulations for the 3D structural-acoustic system are carried out by Matlab R2012 on a 3.00GHz Petium(R) 4 CPU computer. Under the assumption that the physical properties and external load are deterministic, the first-order characteristic frequency locates at 78Hz. Thus, we choose 68–88Hz as the target frequency range in the numerical example. Besides, one node near the ear of driver is selected as the observation point. For the eleven selected frequencies, the lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) of the sound pressure amplitude at the observation point calculated by Monte Carlo method (abbreviated as MCM), FIPPM and MIPPM are listed in 
                     Table 2. The response ranges obtained by MCM with 106 samples are used as referenced results for validating the accuracy of the proposed method, and the relative errors of FIPPM and MIPPM are also listed in the table. From the comparison between the relative errors, it can be observed that the accuracy of MIPPM in which the higher order terms are retained is much higher than the accuracy of FIPPM where only the first-order perturbation terms are considered. Computational cost is another index to evaluate the performances of numerical methods. From the computational execution time listed in Table 2, we can see that the execution time of MIPPM is much shorter than that of MCM but is a little longer than that of FIPPM, and the exceeded time is implemented to approximate higher order terms. Compared with the improvement in accuracy, the increase of computational effort is deemed acceptable. Compared with MCM, the numerical results calculated by MIPPM are completely reliable and greatly reduce the huge computational cost of MCM.

In the subsequent acoustic optimization problem, we choose the average sound pressure level in the frequency range from 68Hz–88Hz nearby the first-order characteristic frequency as the noise index of the car. Thicknesses of the front glass, rear glass, roof and steel structure are assigned to be the design variables

                     where β stands for the safety factor. A factor of one means that the constraint is at the allowable limit, while a higher safety factor means a more conservative design.

Based on MIPPM, the acoustic response bounds can be efficiently predicted and the original nested optimization problem is transformed into a single-layer one, which can be easily solved by the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm in Isight. Given the reliability index 
                        η
                        =
                        0.8
                     , the convergence is reached after 40 iterations in the feasible region and the iterative curves are plotted in 
                     
                     
                     Figs. 4–6. The mean structural mass receives significantly reduction from 283.18kg to 240.28kg as shown in Fig. 5. Besides, the iterative curve in Fig. 6 illustrates that when the reliability index is set to be less than 1, the upper bound of the sound pressure level is allowed appropriately beyond the constraint of 60.0dB. The conclusion is consistent with the definition of the interval satisfaction degree as shown in Eq. (40).

Similarly, for different reliability indices, the optimal results are listed in 
                     Table 3. By comparing the results with the traditional deterministic optimization, in which the safety factor is set to be β=1.1, we can observe that the proposed uncertain optimization method can gain a better effect of mass reduction. Besides, comparison between the optimal values with different reliability indices further demonstrates the conclusion that to obtain a higher reliability, expending a certain objective function is required.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

By combining the interval theory with finite element method, this paper proposes a modified interval parameter perturbation method and a reliability-based optimization model to design the coupled structural-acoustic system with interval parameters. The uncertainties in material properties and boundary conditions are all fully considered, which makes the calculation more objective. Interval characters of the non-linear coefficient matrix and vector can be efficiently determined based on the modified Taylor series. By contrast with the traditional FIPPM, the interval matrix inverse in MIPPM is conducted by a modified Neumann series in which part of higher order terms are retained. Thus, the MIPPM can obtain more accurate response bounds and greatly reduce the huge computational cost of Monte Carlo simulation. Given full consideration to uncertain parameters in the model-establishing phase, the proposed reliability-based optimization technology can capture better design results compared with traditional deterministic optimization. Besides, application of MIPPM eliminates the nested optimization and greatly improves the computing efficiency. Numerical results on a complex 3D car model fully validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model and method to deal with the coupled structural-acoustic system with interval uncertainties in both physical parameters and boundary conditions. However, it should be noted that the additional computational burden to calculate matrix inverses is the disadvantage of MIPPM, especially for the case with a large number of uncertain parameters.
