                  This paper presents the formulation of beam finite elements based on Deslauriers–Dubuc interpolating wavelets, also known as Interpolets. Unlike other wavelet families like Daubechies, Interpolets possess rational filter coefficients, are smooth, symmetric and therefore more suitable for use in numerical methods. Displacement and rotation shape functions are obtained and presented graphically. Expressions for stiffness matrix and force vector are developed based on connection coefficients, which are inner products of basis functions and their derivatives. In order to validate the formulation, several examples with increasing level of complexity are tested and results are compared with analytical and standard beam element solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a versatile tool for solving numerical problems. Its main advantage over other methods is its geometrical flexibility, which allows the use of complex and irregular meshes. Another known advantage of the FEM is how it naturally deals with boundary conditions.

Compactly supported wavelets emerged from the need to find new ways of representing functions with a finite number of components, especially the ones with high gradients and singularities, other than the traditional Fourier analysis, which requires an infinite number of components for exact representation. Later, it was shown that wavelets have several properties that are especially useful for representing solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs), such as orthogonality, compact support and exact representation of polynomials of a certain degree [1]. These characteristics allow the efficient and stable calculation of functions at different levels of resolution, both in time and frequency domain.

In the last three decades, wavelet functions have been widely used in the solution of numerical problems, such as image compression and financial analysis. More recently, these functions have been applied in numerical schemes such as the FEM. Among these applications are thermal conduction analyses [2] and wave propagation problems [3,4].

The conventional formulation of the FEM uses polynomials for interpolating the displacement within the elements (shape functions). This work proposes the use of a different family of functions called Interpolating Wavelets as basis functions in order to obtain satisfactory results in terms of stability and convergence with less refined meshes than the traditional FEM would require.

The most commonly used wavelet family of functions is the one developed by Ingrid Daubechies [5]. The mathematical foundations for the wavelet theory were formulated for Daubechies wavelets and then extended to other families.

A complete basis of wavelets can be generated through dilation and translation of a mother scaling function. This mother function is defined using a recursive linear combination of these basis functions, whose weights are called filter coefficients. This recursive scheme is called pyramidal algorithm [6]. Although many applications use only the wavelet filter coefficients, there are some which explicitly require the values of the basis functions and their derivatives at some target points.

Compactly supported wavelets have a finite number of derivatives which can be highly oscillatory. This makes the numerical evaluation of integrals of their inner products difficult and unstable [7]. Those integrals are called connection coefficients and they appear naturally in a Finite Element scheme. Due to some properties of wavelet functions, these coefficients can be obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem using filter coefficients.

Working with dyadically refined grids, Deslauriers and Dubuc [8] obtained a new family of wavelets with interpolating properties, later called Interpolets. Their filter coefficients are obtained from the autocorrelation of the same order Daubechies' coefficients. As a consequence, interpolets are symmetric and smooth, which is especially interesting in numerical analysis. Another advantage of Interpolets is that their representation of a function as a weighted sum leads to coefficients which are evaluations of the same function at target points on a dyadic mesh. Additionally, the number of vanishing moments of Interpolets is greater than Daubechies' of the same order, which allows exact representation of higher degree polynomials. The adoption of interpolating wavelets in numerical methods has been presented in some works which have combined wavelets and modified scaling basis functions in a FE scheme [9,10].

The formulation of an Interpolet-based Finite Element system is demonstrated for one-dimensional beam problems and a general approach allows different orders of scaling functions to be tested. Shape functions, stiffness matrices and equivalent nodal forces are explicitly derived using scaling functions without additional modifications. Several examples with increasing level of complexity were studied successfully. Results were accurate not only for displacements but also for rotations and bending moments if compared with standard beam finite elements.

Unlike trigonometric functions, the distinguishing feature about wavelets is that they are localized in space, which allows local variations of the problem to be analyzed at various levels of resolution. Thus, multiresolution analysis using orthogonal, compactly supported wavelets has been successfully applied in numerical simulation.

All the mathematical foundation for wavelet functions is based on the algorithms for Daubechies wavelets. Wavelet basis are composed of two kinds of functions: scaling functions (φ) and wavelet functions (ψ). The two combined form a complete Hilbert space of square integrable functions. The spaces generated by scaling and wavelet functions are complementary and both are based on the same mother function. In the following expressions, known as the two-scale relation, a

In general, there are no analytical expressions for wavelet functions, which can be obtained using iterative procedures like Eq. (1). In order to comply with the requirements of orthogonality and compact support, wavelets present, in general, an irregular fractal-like shape. 
                     Fig. 1 shows Daubechies scaling function of order N=4.

The term interpolet was first used by Donoho [12] to designate wavelets with interpolating characteristics. The basic characteristics of interpolating wavelets require that the mother scaling function satisfies the following condition [13]:

The last expression in Eq. (6) derives from the vanishing moments property, which states that polynomials q(x) of degree up to N−1 can be exactly represented in a closed interval as a linear combination of Deslauriers–Dubuc scaling functions of order N:

In Eq. (8), index k varies according to the translations needed to cover the interval within which the representation is intended. The number of degrees of freedom (DOFs) of a wavelet scaling function is given by the number of translations needed to cover a unitary interval at level of resolution j=0. For Daubechies this number is N−1 and for Interpolets is 2N−2.

Interpolets fill the same requirements as other wavelets, specially the two-scale relation (Eq. 1), which is fundamental for their use as interpolating functions in numerical methods, such as the FEM.

A Deslauriers–Dubuc Interpolet of order 2p−1 (in which p is the number of vanishing moments of the corresponding Daubechies wavelet) is capable of representing exactly a polynomial of the same degree. The interpolet φ(x) is obtained by an autocorrelation of the Daubechies scaling function φ

The scaling function obtained through Eq. (9) is symmetric and has a support given by [1−N, N−1], in which N is the order of the Daubechies scaling function used in its construction. Interpolet functions also satisfy the scaling condition with a support adjustment:

                        Table 1 shows the typical values of filter coefficients for interpolets of orders 4, 6 and 8.


                        
                        Fig. 2 shows the autocorrelation of the fourth order Daubechies scaling function (DB4) which generates the Interpolet IN4. Its support is given by [−3 3] (DB4 support is [0 3]) and it is capable of representing polynomials of order up to 3. Its symmetry and interpolating properties are evident.

The 2N−2 DOFs interpolet can represent exactly a N−1 polynomial. This interpolet is based on a N−1 Daubechies scaling function which can represent exactly an N/2−1 degree polynomial. There is, therefore, an improvement in the ability to represent polynomials when comparing interpolets and wavelets.

The process of solving a differential equation (DE) using numerical methods involves derivatives of the basis functions. Such derivatives are obtained in dyadic grid points and the refinement of the solution depends on the level of resolution needed [15]. The scale relation in Eq. (1) can be differentiated d times, generating the following expression:

Eq. (13) is an eigenvalue problem which, for unique solution, has to be normalized using the so-called moment equation, derived from the scaling function property of exact polynomial representation. This equation was introduced by Latto et al. [16] and provides a relation between derivative values at integer points. It is obtained by the differentiation of a degree d monomial which for interpolating wavelets can be written in a trivial form using the property given by Eq. (5) using j=0:

The limits of the integral in Eq. (16) depend on which method is used to impose boundary conditions. In this work, this limits are given by [0 1] to provide a unitary wavelet space. Wavelet dilation and translation properties allow the calculation of connection coefficients within the interval [0 1] to be summarized by the solution of an eigenvalue problem based only on filter coefficients [18].

In the traditional formulation of the FEM, the Euler–Bernoulli beam element uses cubic polynomials as basis functions to interpolate displacements, therefore providing 4 DOFs per element. Since Deslauriers–Dubuc Interpolets of order N have 2N−1 independent coefficients, internal DOFs will appear. 
                     Fig. 3 shows how the DOFs of a beam finite element based on interpolet IN4 are distributed along the element.

Assuming the lateral displacement w to be approximated by a series of interpolating scaling functions, the following may be written:

                                    k

In the case of an interpolet function, the index k can vary between 2−N and N−1, which are all the translations of the function that contain the interval [0 1]. Since the interpolation coefficients (β) in Eq. (21) are in wavelet space, there is the need of a transformation matrix which relates the wavelet DOFs with the physical DOFs in the beam element. This transformation matrix is obtained by evaluating the wavelet basis at the element node coordinates.

According to Euler–Bernoulli's hypothesis, the rotations are derivatives of lateral displacements, providing the following representation:

In order to assure a reasonable accuracy of an interpolet-based beam element at least IN6 should be used for a linearly distributed load. If all the loads in the element are concentrated, IN4 will be enough to represent displacements and bending moments correctly.

The shape functions of a finite element are constructed in order to obtain the displacement at any point using nodal displacements as interpolating coefficients.

It is evident that consecutive Interpolet-based shape functions are symmetric respect to one another. This property would not be present if Daubechies wavelets were used as basic functions.

For the equivalent nodal forces, it is assumed that any distributed load applied to the structure is a polynomial. Some terms related to the length of the element emerge from coordinate changes, since nondimensional coordinates (ξ) within the interval [0 1] are used in wavelet space. The substitution of the shape functions (Eq. 27) in k and f leads to expressions which are dependent on connection coefficients, whose calculation was previously developed in Eqs. (17) and (18).

The application of concentrated loads and the imposition of boundary conditions are performed using the same principles applied in the traditional FEM.

In order to validate the interpolet-based finite elements, several examples were tested with different loadings and boundary conditions. Results were compared with standard cubic polynomial beam elements. Some of the examples present a higher degree of complexity, such as the bending of a beam on elastic foundation and the analysis of an axisymmetric cylindrical shell.

As shown in 
                        Fig. 6, the first example consists in a doubly clamped beam with a linear distributed load applied at its right side. This example was used by Ma et al. [19] in the validation of the Daubechies wavelet beam finite element, using DB12.

In order to represent the analytical solution exactly (a fifth-degree polynomial on the right side), at least IN6 should be used. To verify the behavior of lower-order elements and compare their results, elements based on IN4 were also tested, taking into account that they are not able to represent accurately the analytical response.


                        
                        
                        Figs. 7 and 8 show displacement and rotation results for IN4 and IN6 elements. As expected, the IN4-based finite element is not able to represent exactly the analytical response. It must be noted that even cubic polynomial elements also present inaccurate results at interior points of the beam, especially for rotations and bending moments.


                        
                        Fig. 9 shows a simple scheme of a beam on a Winkler elastic foundation subjected to a concentrated load at its midpoint. The stiffness of the foundation is given by c. This beam was analyzed using IN6 and IN8 elements. The results for displacements and rotations are shown in 
                        
                        Figs. 10 and 11. Elements based on IN6 and IN8 give accurate results even for the interpolation of the rotation.

The bending moment at the beam's midpoint is given by:

A look at Table 2 indicates that the results obtained using interpolets present satisfactory accuracy. For example, two IN8 elements (26 DOFs) produce results that are comparable to the ones obtained using 16 standard beam elements (34 DOFs).

A cylindrical tank with its lower edge built-in containing a fluid of specific weight γ can be modeled as an axisymmetric cylindrical shell [20]. This problem is analogous to a beam on elastic foundation. 
                        Fig. 12.

The bending rigidity of the beam (EI) is substituted by the bending rigidity of a thin plate, given by D=Eh
                        3/12(1−ν
                        2) and the stiffness of the elastic foundation is replaced by c=Eh/a
                        2. Since, in general, the length L of the tank is larger than its radius a, the shell can be considered as being infinitely long. 
                        
                        Figs. 13 and 14 show the results, which are in good accordance with the analytical solution.

The bending moment per unit length at the base of the shell is given by:

                        Table 3 shows the results for the bending moment per unit length at the base of the shell using β=2π and L=1, followed by the comparison with standard beam element response. The total number of degrees of freedom used in each case is shown in parentheses.

A look at Table 3 indicates that the results obtained using Interpolets present satisfactory accuracy. For instance, one IN8 element (14 DOFs) produces results that are comparable to the ones obtained using 8 standard beam elements (18 DOFs).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper showed the formulation of beam elements based on Deslauriers–Dubuc interpolating wavelets, also known as Interpolets. The main advantage of interpolets over other wavelet families is that any function can be represented as a linear combination of scaling functions in which the coefficients are evaluations of the same function at target points on a dyadic mesh. This characteristic is also convenient for the calculation of connection coefficients and derivatives, thus avoiding numerical approximations.

The number of DOFs present in interpolets leads to non-dyadic divisions within the element, requiring an additional approximation which introduces errors in the transformation matrix. The inaccuracy in some values can be attributed mostly to these approximation errors. Some of the matrices involved become difficult to invert as the order of the interpolet increases.

The interpolet-based finite elements tested presented good accuracy, even when taking into account their high number of DOFs. Some of the examples tested require fine discretization when using standard beam elements. In the case of the axisymmetric shell the model was discretized using only one finite element. In all cases, results for interpolet-based elements were comparable with standard beam elements using fewer DOFs.
