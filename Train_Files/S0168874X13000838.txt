                  In the present paper, a three-dimensional elasticity approach is employed to investigate buckling of heterogeneous functionally graded plates under biaxial compression, shear, tension-compression, and shear-compression load conditions. In this regard, a formulation that employs a full compatible three-dimensional Hermitian element with 168 degrees of freedom and guarantees continuity of the strain and stress components is used. It is known that all of the available famous commercial finite element softwares and the proposed series solutions satisfy continuity conditions of the displacement rather than the stress components. Buckling occurrence is detected based on checking both the instability onset and equilibrium criteria. Results are extracted based on a Galerkin-type orthogonality. Therefore, they are more accurate than those obtained based on the traditional Ritz method. The presented three-dimensional finite element analysis and the extracted results are quite new. A vast variety of results including results of biaxial compression, compression-tension, shear, and shear-compression load cases is considered and discussed in detail.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Plate-type structural components are extensively used in majority of the engineering structures, among them, those employed in aerospace, naval, power plant, mechanical, civil, and ground vehicle structures. Due to the optimization targets frequently considered in these components, to minimize the costs, weights, fuel consumption, etc., these components may be vulnerable to sever in-plane loads (e.g., compression, shear, or a combination of them). Therefore, reliability of design of such components requires carefully evaluating the buckling loads which can heavily limit the allowable bearing capacity.

Majority of the available researches on the buckling of the rectangular plates have mainly been performed for isotropic or composite plates. Shariyat investigated static and dynamic mechanical, thermal, and thermo-electromechanical buckling and postbuckling of the composite and sandwich plates, employing higher-order, layerwise, and global–local plate theories [1–6]. Shen [7,8] and Shen et al. [9,10] used the classical plate theory and a perturbation technique for buckling and postbuckling analysis of the simply supported, laminated rectangular composite plates under biaxial compressive loadings. They used a Galerkin perturbation technique to determine the buckling and post-buckling equilibrium paths of laminated plates with or without elastic foundations. Zhong and Zhang [11] studied dynamic buckling, post-buckling, and mode jumping behaviors of clamped angle-ply laminated composite plates under biaxial compression.

Majority of the available buckling studies on flat plates undergoing mechanical loads have been accomplished under axial or biaxial compressive loads. Nevertheless, some few researchers have investigated buckling of plates under shear loads. Budiansky [12] studied shear buckling of the isotropic clamped rectangular plates. Smith et al. [13] presented a Rayleigh–Ritz method for local buckling analysis of rectangular unilaterally restrained plates in pure shear, using the classical plate theory. Azikov [14] investigated buckling of composite plates subjected to combined in-plane compression and shear. Loughlan [15] examined effect of the bend-twist coupling on the shear buckling behavior of the laminated composite plates using a finite strip procedure and the classical plate theory. Kim et al. [16] carried out a buckling and postbuckling analysis for composite plates under pure shear. Han et al. [17] studied postbuckling behavior of laminated composite plates under the combination of in-plane shear, compression and lateral loading, using a Lagrangian finite element-based formulation and the first-order shear-deformation plate theory. Lopatin and Korbut [18] studied buckling of clamped orthotropic laminated plates under shear loads, based on the classical plate theory. Chirica and Beznea [19] analyzed influence of the initial delaminations on buckling behavior of composite plates under shear and compression loadings numerically and experimentally. Explicit expressions were developed by Tarján et al. [20] for buckling analysis of long rectangular plates with constrained edges under shear and linearly varying axial loads, using Rayleigh-Ritz method. Wu and Nie [21] studied shear buckling of the steel-concrete composite slabs considering influence of the interface shear stiffness. The buckling and fracture collapse mechanisms in an elastic rectangular thin-plate with a central straight crack under shear loading were analyzed by Brighenti and Carpinteri [22], for different boundary conditions. An analytical solution was established by Yang et al. [23] for shear buckling of anisotropic rectangular thin plates having arbitrary boundary conditions along their edges or at their corners. Few studies may be found in literature on buckling analysis of the rectangular heterogeneous functionally graded plates [24–28]. Postbuckling analysis of functionally graded plates under edge compression and temperature field conditions was presented by Lee et al. [29], using the element-free Ritz method, the first-order shear-deformation plate theory, and a von Kármán-type nonlinear strain–displacement relationship.

Very rare buckling analyses have been presented so far based on the general three-dimensional theory of elasticity [30] or based on a three-dimensional elasticity with a uniform prebuckling stress assumption [31] which is equivalent to the membrane assumption used in plate theories. Uymaz and Aydogdu studied mechanical buckling of rectangular functionally graded plates under biaxial [32] and shear [33] loads and different boundary conditions. The analyses were performed based on the linear strain energy concept and Ritz method. The displacement components were described by Chebyshev polynomials.

In the present paper, a three-dimensional elasticity approach is employed to investigate buckling of heterogeneous functionally graded plates under biaxial compression, shear, tension-compression, and shear-compression load conditions. It is known that plates fabricated from transversely-graded materials generally have asymmetric material distributions. Recently, the authors [34] have proposed graded finite element and boundary element formulations that are capable of accurately tracing variations of the material properties within the body and consequently, obtaining relatively accurate results. In the present research, this formulation is extended further to present a Hermitian graded finite element formulation that guarantees continuity of the strain and stress components. It is known that all of the available famous commercial finite element softwares employ elements that are mainly suitable for homogeneous materials and satisfy the continuity condition of the displacement rather than the stress components. On the other hand, since present results are extracted based on a Galerkin-type orthogonality, they are more accurate than those obtained based on the traditional Ritz method. Buckling analysis is performed in the present research on the basis of checking both the instability and equilibrium criteria. A wide diversity of examples is considered in the present research to extract more practical conclusions.

Let us consider a functionally graded rectangular plate whose length, width, and thickness are denoted by a, b, and h, respectively (
                     Fig. 1).

As Fig. 1 shows, the plate may be subjected to biaxial compression, in-plane shear or a combination of them. It is assumed that the plate is fabricated from a functionally graded material that is a mixture of two constituent materials, e.g., a metal and a ceramic. The volume fraction of the metallic constituent material is assumed to vary across the thickness according to the following power law:

                     where n is the positive-definite volume fraction index and the z coordinate is measured from the bottom surface of the plate. Therefore, if the subscripts c and m stand respectively for the ceramic and metal, the following distribution may be assigned for the elasticity modulus through the thickness of the plate [35]:

The plate is discretized using full compatible Hermitian-type elements with 21 degrees of freedom defined in each node. Therefore, the total number of degrees of freedom of the element is 168. The u, v, and w displacement components are defined along the x, y, and z directions, respectively. In Hermitian elements, the first-order derivatives of the displacement components are usually defined to guarantee continuity of the strain components and in turn, continuity of the stress components. The available well-known commercial finite element softwares employ Lagrangian elements with nodal degrees of freedom that contain only the displacement components.

To ensure that the derivatives as well as the integrals are path-independent, the second-order mixed derivatives of the displacement components are also defined in the nodal points, in the present research. To present a general approach, the initial elements are mapped into the natural coordinate system, first. In the current special case, coordinates 
                        ξ
                     , 
                        η
                     , and 
                        ζ
                      of this system are located along the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively (
                     Fig. 2). It is known that value of each natural coordinate varies between −1 and 1. Therefore, the following degrees of freedom are defined at each node of the present full compatible three-dimensional solid element:

As Fig. 2 shows, the element has only two nodal points along each side. Therefore, p-refinement instead of h-refinement is used. In such cases, accuracy of the results may be enhanced drastically. So that in some circumstances, number of elements of a Lagrangian mesh (the common mesh of the commercial finite element softwares) may be reduced to less than one hundredth of the original number through using the p-refinement, to achieve the same accuracy [36,37]. Shape functions of each element may be obtained based on the concept of separation of variables. Denoting the nodes, in accordance with each coordinate (in each direction) by 1 and 2 if value of the mentioned coordinate is −1 and 1, respectively, one may express interpolation functions of a representative displacement

In the prebuckling state, no transverse displacements or large deformations exist. Therefore, only the linear strain components appear. Since slope of the plate is not zero at the buckling state, the nonlinear terms of the strain-displacement expressions have to be considered. On the other hand, from Eq. (10) or directly from the principle of minimum total potential energy:

To achieve a computationally economic algorithm, Eq. (31) has to be rewritten in a condensed form before commencing the solution process, as explained in Section 4.

Some of the quantities appeared in Fig. 2 cannot be determined directly. On the other hand, if all degrees of freedom of the element appear in the final governing system of equations, huge numerical computations will be required. In the present research, we used the condensation technique to minimize size of the final system of equations [36]. Indeed, if the degrees of freedom are categorized as those that can be determined directly (

For simply supported edges, only displacements of the reference plane, e.g., the neutral plane or mid-surface of the plate, have to be set equal to zero.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

Convergence of results of the present research is investigated through comparing results of successive refinement of the element size. As mentioned before, since a complex high-order element is used in the analysis, convergence is achieved by using a small number of elements. Furthermore, as it is mentioned in the foregoing section, since a condensation technique is employed to extract the results, size of the final system of equations is decreased before solution.

The condensation technique, that constitutes the basis for solving the huge systems of algebraic equations in the famous commercial finite element softwares such as NASTRAN, ANSYS, ABAQUS, and I-DEAS, leads to exact results when used for general static or dynamic systems, since it merges effects of some degrees of freedom into the others, so that the final system include a few unknown degrees of freedom. In the modal analyses (e.g., free vibration and buckling analyses), the condensation technique may lead to Lancoz-type algorithms. In these situations, due to incorporating less degrees of freedom, the reduced system will provide less eigen values and modal shapes. Therefore, the predicted buckling loads may encounter a degree of inaccuracy. The mentioned inaccuracy will be more pronounced when very small amounts of degrees of freedom (e.g., one thousandth of the original number of the degrees of freedom) are retained in the final system of equations. In the present analysis, number of the retained degrees of freedom is not very small. Therefore, the total potential (or mechanical) energy of the system can be represented by the mentioned degrees of freedom. For the present research, this issue is checked by comparing results of the original and reduced systems of equations for a special case. The results were almost coincident. For this reason, results of the mentioned comparative study have not been reported here.

Verification of the results is accomplished through a comparative example. The remaining examples of the present section contain quite new results.

In the present section, two verification examples are considered. As a first verification example, buckling of a simply-supported Al/Al2O3 functionally graded rectangular plate under uniaxial and biaxial compressions, treated previously by references [39,40], is reexamined.

                         (in MN) are compared with results of references [39,40], in 
                        Table 1 for various side to thickness (a/h) ratios. As it may be readily deduced, present results are close to results of the high-order shear deformation theory of reference [40]. However, due to using a three-dimensional theory and a C1-contineouos solution instead the C0-continueous formulation of references [39,40], present results are more accurate.

In the C0-continuous (Lagragian) elements that have been thus far the only three-dimensional elements of the famous commercial finite element softwares, only continuity of the displacement components (rather than their derivatives) may be incorporated. Therefore, e.g., in the beam or shell elements, due to discontinuity in the slopes, sharp edges or corners may be formed at the mutual edges or nodal points of the elements under a transverse or buckling loading. On the other hand, the strain and consequently stress components are generally linear combinations of the first derivatives of the displacement components. Therefore, in contrast to the C0-continuous elements, using a C1-continuous displacement field, guarantees that the first derivatives of the displacement components be continuous at the mutual boundaries of the elements. In other words, employing C1-continuous elements leads to strain and stress components that are continuous at the mutual boundaries of the elements; an evident that cannot be satisfied through using C0-continuous elements. In the C0-continuous elements, significant jumps may be noticed in the stress and strain components at the mutual edges and nodes of the elements. In the well-known commercial softwares this shortcoming is artificially covered in depicting variations of the stress components or effective stresses, through using averaged quantities at the nodal points or plotting 3D surfaces that pass through the Gaussian rather than the nodal points. Some researchers have already proven that using C0-continuous elements may lead up to 200 or even 300 per cent discrepancies relative to the exact solutions, in special cases [37,41,42]. C1-continuous elements require using a p-type refinement [37], i.e., utilizing Hermitian elements. As Fig. 2 shows, C1-continuity is forced in the present research through defining derivatives of the displacement components as single-valued degrees of freedom at the nodal points. In the traditional Lagrangian (i.e., C0-continuous) elements, values of these derivatives at the nodal points are dependent on values of the displacement nodal quantities of each element. It is evident that not all nodal quantities of the adjacent elements of the Lagragian elements are identical.

The higher-order theories, among them the present three-dimensional theory of elasticity with the defined nodal degrees of freedom, allow definition of more independent displacement parameters/modes and consequently, more movability. Therefore, the resulting model of the structure will be more compliant and flexible. For this reason, buckling loads predicted by the high-order plate theory are generally lower than those of the classical plate theory and in turn, results of the present approach are lower than those of the high-order theory. Therefore, trend of the results reported in Table 1 is verified once again.

As another verification example, results of the present research are compared with results of other researchers for buckling under pure shear loads. Present results are compared with recently published results of Shufrin and Eisenberger [43] and Wu et al. [44] for homogenous isotropic plates (n=0). Both of the mentioned references have used the classical plate theory (CPT). Shufrin and Eisenberger [43] obtained the solutions using the multi-term extended Kantorovich method (EKM) whereas Wu et al. [44] approximated the solutions by the extended spline collocation method (SCM). Results are extracted for simply supported plates with aspect ratios a/b=1, 1.5, 2, and 3. It is evident that the mathematical description of the boundary conditions used in the classical plate theory may not be employed for the present three-dimensional elasticity approach. In the present research, the edge conditions presented in Eq. (44) are used for description of the simply supported edge conditions. For the simply supported edges, only displacements of the reference plane, i.e., the neutral plane or mid-surface of the plate, have to be set equal to zero. Geometric and material properties of the plates are assumed to be

                         is the critical shear buckling load. Results of the present three-dimensional elasticity approach are compared in 
                        Table 2 with results of the classical plate theory of Shufrin and Eisenberger [43] and Wu et al. [44]. Since the considered plates are very thin, the results show an excellent agreement. It is known that results of the classical plate are only accurate for thin plates. As in the foregoing example, results of the present three-dimensional theory of elasticity approach are lower.

In the present section, results are obtained for both uniaxial and biaxial compressions.

The first six uniaxial buckling loads of the functionally graded square plate are given in 
                        Table 3, for various volume fraction indices. When the volume fraction index increases, the overall volume fraction of the metallic constituent material of the plate decreases. Consequently, stiffness of the cross sections and in turn, the buckling load increases. The first four buckling modes are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 3. As expected, due to symmetry of the boundary conditions, only one half sine buckling wave formed in both x and y directions. It is known that for an integer aspect ratio of the plate (a/b), one buckling wave appears across the plate (parallel to the loaded edge) and a number of buckling waves equal to the aspect ratio appears along the other dimension [45].

The first six buckling loads associated with the biaxial compression are given in Table 3. The relevant buckling modes are depicted in 
                        Fig. 4. Since in this case, the diagonal lines are also symmetry lines, some of the extrema points and the buckling grid nodes (those associated with zero lateral deflections) are formed on these lines.

To investigate influence of the aspect ratio of the plate on the buckling loads and buckling modes of the plate, length of the plate is increased to twice. As results of Table 3 reveal, since the area of the plate is increased (while fixing the thickness), the buckling loads have decreased. The buckling modes are plotted in 
                        Fig. 5. As it may be readily seen, the resulting buckling mode shapes are different from those of the square plate.

First, results of a square plate whose edges are subjected to uniform shear loads are extracted. In this regard, the first four buckling loads of the plate and their relevant buckling modes are given in 
                        Table 4 and 
                        Fig. 6, respectively. Since in this type of loading (as Mohr circle confirms), the maximum compressive stress occurs along a direction makes a 45 degree angle with the edges, the resulting buckling waves appear along the mentioned direction. As before, due to symmetry, only one buckling wave has appeared in the x or y direction.

Results of the rectangular plate are computed for aspect ratios a/b=2 and 4 and reported in Table 4. 
                        Fig. 7 shows that in contrast to cases studied in the previous section, the fundamental buckling mode is not axisymmetric with respect to the diagonal lines of the plate. Aspect ratio is changed by increasing the length of the plate (a). Due to increasing the plate area, the buckling loads have decreased. Buckling modes of the plate are depicted in 
                        Figs. 7 and 8. A quick glance to results illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8 reveal that the buckling loads are still oblique and make the same 45 degrees angle with the edges of the plate (if identical scales are chosen for the x and y coordinates). As it may be expected, number of the buckling waves increases with length of the plate.

Finally, the most complicated cases of buckling under anti-phase compression-tension and combined compression-shear loads are investigated.

Buckling loads of a functionally graded square plate undergoes compressions in the x direction and tensions (with identical magnitude) in the y direction are reported in 
                        Table 5. Since the mean compressive loads are smaller than those of a plate subjected to a biaxial compression, the buckling loads reported in Table 5 are greater than those of Table 3. The corresponding buckling modes are shown in 
                        Fig. 9. As it may be easily deduced, the mode shapes are quite different from those of a plate under biaxial compression. Influence of the aspect ratio on the buckling loads and buckling modes may be seen in Table 5. 
                        Fig. 10 shows that the buckling mode shapes change when the aspect ratio changes (as it may be expected).

Mode shapes of a square plate under combined compression and shear are plotted in 
                        Fig. 11. The fundamental buckling mode shapes resemble those of both the axial compression and shear loading. However, the buckling waves do not make an angle of 45 degrees with the edges of the plate. In this case, even the direction of the shear has significant effect on the magnitude of the buckling loads and the resulting mode shapes. Buckling loads are reported in 
                        Table 6. The buckling loads are lower than those of the uniaxial compression and pure share load cases. Buckling loads corresponding to aspect ratios a/b=2 and a/b=4 are also reported in Table 6 whereas the corresponding buckling mode shapes are illustrated in 
                        
                        Figs. 12 and 13, respectively.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the present paper, a three-dimensional elasticity approach is employed to investigate buckling of heterogeneous functionally graded plates under biaxial compression, shear, tension-compression, and shear-compression load conditions. Some of the novelties of the present research are:
                        
                           (i)
                           A full three-dimensional formulation that considers the instability as well as the equilibrium conditions, is employed. Majority of the available researches have been accomplished based on the approximate plate theories.

A full three-dimensional Hermitian element with 168 degrees of freedom including second-order partial differential derivatives of the displacement components is employed. Complexity of the computations reduced significantly through using an adequate condensation technique.

In contrast to the available finite element and series solutions (among them, the series solutions presented for the elasticity problems), the present solution is a C1-continuous rather than C0-continuous one. In other words, in contrast to the available solutions, present solution guarantees continuity of the stress components in addition to continuity of the displacement components.

Results are extracted based on a Galerkin-type orthogonality.

A vast variety of results including results of biaxial compression, compression-tension, shear, and shear-compression load cases are considered and discussed in detail.
