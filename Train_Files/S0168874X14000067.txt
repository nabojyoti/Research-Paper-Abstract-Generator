                  Sandwich panels designed to resist blasts and high-velocity impacts usually dissipate most of the delivered energy through inelastic deformation of solids. A concept is explored in this study to improve the energy absorption of such structures by the addition of a viscous mechanism. The mechanism relies on the fact that when a viscous liquid is forced through narrow passages at high speeds, it undergoes high shear rates that cause viscous energy dissipation. A simple test specimen in the form of a steel tube with capillaries attached at both ends was chosen for study. Both empty and liquid-filled test specimens were subjected to experimental and simulated drop-weight impact tests and simulated blast load tests. Fluid structure interaction analyses in the form of Coupled-Eulerian–Lagrangian simulations were performed to assess the energy dissipated both by solid plastic deformation and liquid viscous dissipation in the drop-weight and blast simulations. The liquid flow speeds generated by the applied loads were found to be a critical factor in determining the contribution of the viscous mechanism. The moderate liquid flow speeds generated by the drop-weight impacts resulted in negligible viscous energy dissipation. The simulated blast loads generated much higher liquid flow speeds and as a result the viscous energy contribution to the total absorbed energy in the test specimens approached 30%. The viscosity of the liquid has a major effect on the fraction of energy absorbed in the form of viscous dissipation. Results of this study support the viability of the concept of viscous-assist for improving the ability of protective panels and structures to withstand high-speed impact and blast loads.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Panels designed for impact or blast energy absorption are usually either monolithic plates or sandwich constructions. Depending on the blast and impact intensities that are anticipated, these energy-absorbing panels can be constructed of metals such as steel or aluminum or of polymer matrix composites. Sandwich constructions can have cores that could be honeycombs, foams, and other such lightweight, energy-absorbing geometries [1,2]. For high intensity blasts and impacts, metals are still the material of choice for constructing energy absorbing panels [3]. Metals such as steel, when used in panels, are capable of absorbing a significant amount of energy from blasts and impacts thereby providing protection to the target. This energy is absorbed primarily by plastic deformation [4].

A blast or high velocity impact event can cause damage to energy-absorbing panels in multiple ways. Severe penetration and perforation of the panel can result. Even without perforation, there could be extensive deformation causing harm to the target. Shock and stress waves can propagate through the panel and be transmitted onto the target. Deformation and stress wave mitigation can be accomplished by absorbing and redirecting the energy as it works its way through the panel. An example of utilizing this concept is the use of sacrificial cladding in the form of a ductile metal layer over a steel plate [5].

The concept explored in this investigation involves the use of a viscous assist to the plastic energy absorption in protective structures. While this concept can be implemented in numerous ways, a simple sandwich structure is used as an illustrative model. Consider an array of metallic tubes bonded between two metal face plates, thus forming a sandwich panel. The tubes, filled with a viscous liquid, taper into capillaries at the ends (Fig. 1
                     (a)). When a blast wave or high velocity impact event strikes this viscous-assist sandwich panel (Fig. 1(b)), the panel deforms with a significant amount of the energy absorbed in the plastic deformation of the face plates of the panel and the metal tubes. An additional energy dissipation mechanism that will be triggered is viscous in nature, as the liquid in the tubes is forced out through the capillaries. If a sizeable fraction of the energy absorbed is in the form of viscous dissipation, the resulting lower deformation in the panel will mean reduced penetration into the target.

Several examples exist of the use of liquids for impact and blast energy absorption and stress wave mitigation. Su et al. [6] describe the analysis of a piston-cylinder device that mitigates propagating shock waves by repeated reflections, thereby reducing the peak pressure transmitted. Zakrajsek et al. [7] explored the use of water sheets to reduce the peak overpressure and impulse of a shock wave. They were able to experimentally demonstrate a reduction in the overpressure and impulse transmitted by a shock wave through the water sheet. Liquids containing nanoporous particles have recently been explored as energy absorbing media [8–10]. When such liquid suspensions are subject to a quasi-static or dynamic pressure, the liquid infiltrates into the pores and energy is absorbed and stored as interfacial surface energy at newly created liquid–solid interfaces in the nanopores [9]. Using liquids to absorb impacts in helmets has also been recently explored [11]. Stewart et al. [11] studied the use of fluid filled channels in helmet liners. Testing revealed that the presence of fluid filled channels within a helmet liner improves the helmet performance under impact loads, by decreasing the peak acceleration of the impact and increasing the duration of the impact. Deshmukh and McKinley [12] loaded a cellular solid with a magnetorheological fluid, thus creating a composite medium whose energy absorbing capability can be tuned using applied magnetic fields. Lee et al. [13] used shear thickening fluids to soak a Kevlar fabric to examine the ballistic impact resistance. They demonstrated an increase in ballistic resistance because of the presence of the shear thickening fluid.

There has also been a lot of interest in investigating how liquid-filled tubes and pipes respond to impact loads [14,15]. This is very relevant for applications in the power generation and petrochemical industries. Nishida et al. [14] examined aluminum pipes filled with water and impacted by steel spheres. They found a strong dependence of the pressure generated in the liquid on the impact velocity. In a similar fashion, Lu et al. [15] found that the pressure of the water in water-filled pipes significantly affects the critical perforation energy of the pipes when impacted by projectiles.

In this work, we explore the concept of a viscous-assist mechanism as a means of energy dissipation in a protective panel for blast and impact loads. The feasibility of the concept is explored by numerical fluid–structure-interaction simulations, and experimental testing. In Section 2, a preliminary assessment is performed to explore the viability of the viscous-assist mechanism to cause energy dissipation when viscous liquids are moved rapidly through narrow orifices. In Section 3, we assess the response of a simple viscous-assist test specimen to drop-weight tests. This is done through experiments and finite element simulations. In Section 4, finite element fluid–structure interaction simulations are conducted to assess the response of viscous-assist test specimens to simulated blast loads. Our conclusions are outlined in Section 5.

The preliminary assessment involved idealized, conceptual models on paper. The aim was to establish order-of-magnitude estimates of viscous dissipation energy when a simplified geometry of a viscous-assist panel is subject to blast loads. A second goal was to confirm the conjecture that in the time scales associated with blast pressure pulses, viscous liquids can be moved at high speeds to dissipate energy.

An order-of-magnitude estimate of the viscous dissipation energy was produced by considering a simplified, conceptual model of a viscous-assist sandwich panel. The conceptual panel consisted of two square, rigid flat plates of side length 30cm (12in.), sandwiching a viscous-liquid core. Capillaries of inside diameter 3mm (0.12in.) and length 2.5cm (1in.), spaced 2.5cm (1.0in.) apart, were arrayed around the periphery of the square sandwich panel. A side view of the concept sandwich panel is shown in Fig. 2
                     (a). The effect of a blast pressure pulse acting on the upper square plate of the sandwich is simulated by the rapid downward motion of the plate with an effective downward ‘crushing’ velocity. When the upper plate is driven downward with a high velocity, and the bottom is held rigid, the viscous liquid in the middle is rapidly forced through the capillaries at high speed, thus dissipating some of the blast energy. Fig. 3
                      shows a plot of the viscous energy dissipation rate per capillary as a function of the ‘crushing’ velocity of the upper plate. This dissipation rate is a function of the viscosity of the liquid, which was chosen to be a 30 weight motor oil for these calculations. Temperature dependence of the viscosity was also taken into consideration as can be seen in Fig. 3. The results of the analysis indicated that viscous energy dissipation rate per capillary can exceed 100kW, if the liquid is driven at high enough speeds. When dissipation in all tubes was considered, viscous-liquid flow in the capillaries accounted for 25% of the energy of the pressure pulse, a non-negligible amount. This proof-of-concept calculation demonstrated that when viscous liquids are moved at high speeds through narrow channels, viscous dissipation mechanisms can absorb a significant fraction of the input blast or impact energy.

The assumption that a viscous liquid can be moved at high speeds when exposed to a sharp pressure pulse, in the same time-scale as the pulse, was also verified. To do this, we created a second conceptual model consisting of a long rigid tube with a capillary attached at one end (see Fig. 2(b)). For the purposes of the analysis, the rigid tube had an inside diameter of 2.5cm (1in.) and length 7.6cm (3.0in.), and was connected at one end to a capillary with a 1.0mm (0.04in.) inside diameter, and a length of 7.6cm (3in.). The tube and capillary were assumed to be filled with a viscous liquid (30 weight motor oil at room temperature). At the open end of the tube, an axial pressure pulse decreasing linearly over time from 350MPa (5.08×104
                     psi) to zero was applied. The time duration of the pulse was 0.3ms. The peak pressure of 350MPa (5.08×104
                     psi) was gleaned from blast-panel field test data where 1kg (2.205lbm) of TNT was used. The momentum, continuity, and energy equations were solved for compressible, one-dimensional, frictional flow using the method of characteristics and numerical methods. The results (Fig. 4
                     ) show that it takes 0.064ms for the liquid in the tube to begin to flow into the capillary, a fact consistent with the calculated sound speed in the liquid of 1200m/s (47,200in./s). Thus a viscous liquid will indeed flow as a fluid in the time scales associated with blast pressure pulses. It was also determined that the energy dissipation due to the movement of the liquid in a channel is approximately proportional to the third power of the flow speed. This points to the need for large liquid flow speeds to increase the assist in viscous-assist sandwich panels.

The preliminary analyses described above provided initial support for the concept of viscous-assist in protective shields and panels. However the models considered were highly simplified. Moreover, the focus was only on the liquid and viscous dissipation. The deformation of the solids and more importantly the interaction of the solid and liquid were ignored. In what follows, the focus is on the fluid–structure interaction problem that develops when a liquid loaded solid specimen is subject to impacts or blasts. Both viscous dissipation in the liquid and plastic deformation in the solid are considered. The dependence of the viscous dissipation energy on liquid flow speed is examined by considering two different loading rates. A drop-weight test is studied to generate moderate liquid flow speeds and a simulated blast test is examined for larger flow speeds.

Drop-weight tests were next explored to assess the feasibility of the viscous-assist concept. As mentioned earlier, the liquid flow speeds generated by such loading were expected to be moderate. Plastic and viscous dissipation energy were quantitatively determined by a combination of experimental tests and numerical simulations. In a panel such as illustrated in Fig. 1(a), energy dissipation mechanisms include plastic deformation by bending and stretching of the front and rear face plates, plastic deformation by the crushing of the tubes, and viscous dissipation by liquid flow through the tubes and end capillaries. The focus of the drop-weight testing was on the phenomena occurring in the deforming tubes and flow through the capillaries. Hence, a considerably simplified test specimen configuration was chosen. A single steel tube fitted with capillaries at both ends was utilized (Fig. 6). Drop-weight tests were conducted on these tube-capillary specimens, with tubes either empty or filled with a viscous liquid. Numerical finite element simulations were performed on these specimens as well. The experiments and simulations conducted and the results obtained are presented here.

A gravity drop-weight test rig (Fig. 5
                           ) was designed and built for testing the tube-capillary specimens. The falling mass, which consisted of a ram and striker, had a mass (M
                           
                              s
                           ) of 6.6kg (14.5lbm). The specimen was mounted directly on the base of the rig. The maximum drop height possible in the apparatus was 1.35m (53in.). An Analog Devices ADXL-001 accelerometer, dynamic range of ±500g, was mounted on the striker. National Instruments Labview 2010 was used to log the acceleration as a function of time. Data was recorded at a sampling frequency of 40,000Hz. A Matlab script applied a low pass filter to the data with a normalized cut off frequency of 8000Hz. Integration of the acceleration profile as a function of time provided the velocity of the striker as a function of time. Integration of the velocity profile provided the displacement of the striker and concomitantly the crushing displacement d

                            of the tube specimen. The acceleration (a

                              t

                              s
                            and the area under this curve provides the energy delivered by the falling striker, until it reaches the bottom of its drop. Most of this energy goes into crushing the specimen with some of the energy going into the rebound kinetic energy of the striker.

The tubes and capillaries in the tube-capillary specimens were made of 1018 steel (Fig. 6
                           ). The tube was 20cm (8in.) long, with an outside diameter of 9.53mm (0.375in.) and a wall thickness of 0.90mm (0.035in.). The capillaries attached at each of the two ends were 15.2cm (6in.) long, 2.4mm (0.095in.) in outside diameter, with a wall thickness of 0.30mm (0.012in.). The striking surface of the striker was 7.6cm by 7.6cm (3in. by 3in.). As a result, the impact was felt by a central 7.6cm (3in.) length of the tube. The specimen was positioned at the bottom of the rig on a magnetic steel base, directly beneath and centered under the falling striker. The magnetic base provided a sufficient holding force to keep the specimen in place as it was impacted and deformed. There was little to no lateral displacement of the test specimen during the test.

@&#RESULTS@&#

Tests were conducted using the full drop height of 1.35m (53in.) of the apparatus. As a reference, baseline tests were conducted on empty tube-capillary specimens. Multiple specimens were tested to ensure repeatability. Fig. 7
                           (a) shows acceleration vs. time plots for seven separate tests on empty specimens. Repeatability is apparent from the graphs. Energy delivered by the striker is plotted vs. time for each of these seven tests in Fig. 7(b).

Drop tests were next conducted on test specimens filled with a 30-weight motor oil. On impact, some of the oil was forced out of the tubes through the capillaries. The acceleration vs. time history for these tests is shown in Fig. 8
                           (a). The energy vs. time history is shown in Fig. 8(b). While tests were run on multiple specimens, only two test specimen results are reported here as they are very representative of all the test results seen. In comparing the two sets of results (Figs. 7 and 8), the energy delivered by the drop-weight is identical (~73J). This is consistent with the fact that the drop heights and weights are the same for the two sets of experiments. The peak deceleration is larger for the oil-filled specimen in comparison with the empty specimen. This can be attributed to the ‘stiffening’ effect provided by the presence of the oil in the tube. As the tube is deformed, pressure is generated in the enclosed oil which serves to resist the deformation of the steel tube, causing a sharper rise in the deceleration of the falling striker. The overall plastic deformation of the oil-filled tubes is smaller than that of the empty tubes. This can be seen in Fig. 9
                           . Based on these deformed cross-section views of the tubes in Fig. 9, a greater fraction of the delivered energy goes into the plastic deformation of the empty tubes when compared with the oil-filled tubes. It was also observed that the rebound height of the striker was larger for the oil-filled specimens.

Experimental measurement of the viscous dissipation energy was not possible since the tube specimens could not be instrumented in a meaningful way to make suitable measurements of relevant field quantities that would allow calculation of the viscous energy dissipated. Numerical finite element simulations provide an excellent tool to assess viscous dissipation and plastic deformation in such fluid structure interaction problems. Hence, finite element simulations were conducted of the drop-weight tests in order to determine the magnitude of energy, if any, dissipated by viscous flow of the oil through the tube and capillary for the oil-filled specimens.

Finite element simulations of the drop-weight tests were conducted with Abaqus Explicit 6.11. Simulations were performed for the two separate cases: the empty tube-capillary specimen and the oil-filled tube-capillary specimen. In both cases, the simulated drop-weight tests replicated the conditions of the experimental drop-weight tests with a mass of 6.6kg (14.5lbm) falling from a height of 1.35m (53in.). This corresponds to the mass traveling at a speed of 5.10m/s (16.7ft/s) at the time of impact. The physical dimensions of the tube and capillary in the simulations were identical with that of the experimental tests.


                           Fig. 10
                            shows a comprehensive model that simulates the drop-weight test of a tube-capillary specimen. Symmetry of the problem was taken into consideration to reduce computation time and only a quarter of the geometry was modeled with the corresponding symmetry boundary conditions applied. The bottom surface of the base plate (gray) was constrained from moving in all directions. The contacting surfaces of the specimen holding plate (green) and the base plate were tied together. The tube-capillary specimen was not constrained other than the symmetry boundary conditions applied to it. The striker (brown), drop weight or connecting plate (red) and main cross-bar (blue) were all tied together at their respective contacting surfaces and limited to move only in the direction normal to the base plate (y-direction in Fig. 10).

The material model used for the steel in the tube was a rate-dependent elastic–plastic model [16]. A power law hardening rule was used for strain hardening. The Cowper–Symonds relationship was used for strain rate hardening:

                            is the plastic strain rate. The parameters A, B, and n were obtained from curve fits of the experimental, quasi-static, uniaxial tension tests of the material. The parameters D and q were obtained from Karagiozova et al. [17] who used a similar mild steel in their test program. D was set at 40.4s−1 and parameter q at 5. The material for the striker, base plate, drop-weight, and specimen holding plate was steel and was modeled as a linear elastic material.

The liquid was modeled as a compressible, viscous medium. A Mie–Gruneisen equation of state was used to model the pressure (p) in the liquid as a function of density (ρ) and specific internal energy (internal energy per unit mass, E

                           . The reference density ρ
                           0 and Gruneisen ratio (Γ
                           0) are also provided. The variable η is the nominal volumetric compressive strain. The deviatoric behavior of the liquid was modeled using a traditional Newtonian viscous liquid model with the dynamic viscosity magnitude as indicated in Table 1. This corresponds to the dynamic viscosity of 30-weight motor oil.

A Coupled-Eulerian–Lagrangian (CEL) approach was taken to model the problem. This approach allowed the modeling of the deformation of the solid tube-capillary, and the flow of the liquid in and out of the tube, as well as the interaction between the liquid and the deforming tube. Therefore, the finite element model had two domains: a solid domain for the tube-capillary, the base plate, specimen holding plate, striker, and drop weight and a liquid domain for the viscous liquid in the tube (not shown in Fig. 10). The solid domain was meshed with Lagrangian elements. The solid elements used were three-dimensional hexahedral linear elements with reduced integration. An Eulerian box mesh was constructed around the specimen (tube-capillary) to represent the region in which the liquid could potentially flow during the simulation. This Eulerian box was large enough to allow for deformation of the solid tube and its liquid contents. The liquid domain was meshed with linear, Eulerian, eight-noded brick elements with reduced integration. The Eulerian region was initialized by a liquid volume fraction that represented the initial liquid distribution in the problem. The liquid was initially entirely resident in the tube and capillary. Subsequently, as the liquid flowed in the Eulerian domain as a result of the fluid–structure interaction with the deforming solid tube, the liquid volume fraction was calculated by the Abaqus volume fraction tool using a Boolean operation.

Contact was modeled using the penalty based general contact model in Abaqus. The Eulerian liquid interacted with the Lagrangian solid elements through Eulerian–Lagrangian contact. A no-slip boundary condition was imposed between the liquid and the internal surfaces of the tube and capillary, to simulate the interaction of a viscous liquid with a solid boundary. This hard contact definition forced the liquid to have the same velocity as the solid boundary on contact. Contact between the tube specimen and the striker as well as the specimen support plate was modeled as frictionless. A very refined mesh was used to ensure convergence of solution. Convergence was established in the normal way with the use of progressively refined meshes. A typical converged solution required about 71,000 hexahedral elements in the tube/capillary specimen, 480,000 Eulerian brick elements in the Eulerian box for the liquid flow, and about 500,000 elements in the remainder of the structure of Fig. 10. No leakages were observed at the solid–liquid boundary. Since the simulation was a transient analysis, a dynamic time step was chosen. The explicit dynamics procedure performs a large number of small time increments efficiently. All physical dimensions in the finite element simulation of relevant objects were identical with those of the experiments described in the previous section.

In post-processing, the energy absorbed by the specimen due to plastic deformation was extracted using built-in Abaqus commands. A more elaborate procedure was however required to calculate the viscous dissipation energy in the liquid. At every time step, the pressure in the liquid at all nodes of the Eulerian domain was recorded as well as the liquid velocity in the tube axial direction. Viscous energy dissipation rate for a liquid flowing through a tube or capillary was calculated as the product of the pressure drop and the volume flow rate. At any given instant in time, the instantaneous viscous energy dissipation rate in the specimen was calculated by first evaluating the product of the average pressure drop and the volume flow rate across two successive transverse nodal planes in the Eulerian domain. Summing these products from the middle of the steel tube to the end of the capillary provided the instantaneous viscous energy dissipation rate. Integrating this instantaneous viscous energy dissipation rate with respect to time provided the overall viscous dissipation energy and this was plotted against time. This calculation of the viscous dissipation energy in the liquid was done within Matlab. Other energy contributions to the problem, due to artificial strain energy (hourglassing) and dissipation because of the default bulk viscosity in ABAQUS, were small (less than 2% of the total deformation energy).


                           Fig. 11
                           (a) shows a plot of the plastic deformation energy absorbed by an empty tube-capillary specimen during the drop-weight test as obtained from the finite element simulation. The plastic deformation energy in the tube is shown evolving with time during the drop-weight test. Not all the kinetic energy of the striker is transformed into plastic deformation energy of the tube. Some of it is retained in the striker as kinetic energy as it rebounds after the impact. For this simulation, the input kinetic energy was 71.5J. This energy was re-distributed into: 67J in the plastic deformation of the steel tube, 2.4J as rebound kinetic energy of the striker, with the remaining 2.1J of energy being accounted for by other forms of energy dissipation including hourglassing. This simulation did not involve any fluid structure interaction and as a result the Eulerian box was omitted from the finite element model of Fig. 10.

Simulations were next performed of the drop weight tests on viscous liquid filled specimens. Fig. 11(b) shows the energy absorbed by plastic deformation of the tube and the energy dissipated by viscous means, plotted as a function of time elapsed during the drop-weight test. It is apparent that the viscous dissipation energy is extremely small and negligible in comparison with the plastic deformation. Moreover the overall energy dissipated in the liquid-filled specimen is lower than that of the empty specimen. This is because a greater fraction of the kinetic energy of the falling striker is returned to the striker as rebound kinetic energy in the liquid-filled case. This accounts for the difference in plastic deformation energy in 11(a) and (b), and for the difference in deformation seen in the actual drop-weight tests in Fig. 9. The overall energy balance for the simulation of the drop weight test of the liquid filled tube is as follows. The input kinetic energy of 71.5J was re-distributed into: 52J in the plastic deformation of the steel tube, 16.5J as rebound kinetic energy of the striker, 0.5J through viscous dissipation in the viscous liquid, and the remaining 2.5J by other mechanisms including hourglassing and bulk viscosity related dissipation.


                           Fig. 12
                           (a) shows the peak velocity in the liquid as a function of time. The peak velocity of 30m/s (98ft/s) is rather low and is a primary reason for the negligible viscous dissipation energy. The Reynolds number associated with these velocities is shown as a function of time in Fig. 12(b). The peak Reynolds number is less than 25 which is well below the critical Reynolds number for turbulent flow, thus justifying the use of the Coupled-Eulerian–Lagrangian (CEL) approach in Abaqus 6.11 which relies on the existence of laminar flow for validity. The peak pressure in the liquid is shown as a function of time in Fig. 13
                           . The peak pressure of 60MPa (8700psi) is low and therefore should not cause any rupture of the tube or capillary. No such rupture was seen in the experimental tests either.

The primary conclusion from the experiments and finite element simulations of drop-weight tests was that these drop-weight impacts are inadequate to produce measurable viscous dissipation energy. Consequently the predominant mechanism of energy absorption in these tests was one of plastic deformation in the metal tubes. Higher liquid flow speeds would have to be generated either through more rapid deformation speeds or by a redesign of the tube-capillary geometry in order to produce non-negligible viscous energy dissipation. More rapid liquid flow speeds can be expected when the tube-capillary specimens are exposed to rapid deformations caused by explosive blasts.

Flow speeds of the viscous liquid through the tubes and capillaries can be increased by subjecting the liquid-filled specimens to a blast load. In a drop-weight test, the duration of the impact impulse is about 3ms, as seen in Fig. 11(b). Blast impulses tend to be an order of magnitude smaller in duration. Numerical simulations were used to assess whether blast impulses could generate viscous dissipation energies comparable to plastic deformation energies in a tube-capillary geometry loaded with a viscous liquid.

Fundamentally, two different approaches can be taken to model the interaction of an explosive blast with a structure. In the uncoupled approach, blast loads are first calculated assuming that the structure is rigid. These blast loads are then applied on the structure in the form of a load-time function and the response of the structure is then numerically simulated [19]. The primary purpose of a study that incorporates this uncoupled approach is to examine the behavior of structures under blast impulse loads. In the coupled approach, a fluid–structure interaction analysis is conducted. The problem of the detonation of the explosive, the propagation of the shock wave through air, and its interaction with the structure as the structure deforms is treated in its entirety as a fluid structure interaction problem [20].

Since the primary goal here was to assess the effectiveness of the viscous-assist concept in a structure׳s ability to absorb energy, the uncoupled approach was adopted. The blast was modeled as a pressure-time pulse directly applied to the structure. Several models are available for the blast pressure-time pulse. The modified Friedlander equation uses an exponentially decaying time function to model the dependence of the pressure on time [21]. Other simplified models have been used as well. For instance, Karagiozova et al. [17] and Xue and Hutchinson [19] have used a rectangular pressure-time pulse of short duration to model a blast load on a structure. Hanssen et al. [22] used a triangular pulse to model the decaying pressure time function. The model used for the pressure pulse in our study is shown in Fig. 14
                        . The pressure time history is treated as a trapezoidal hat with a duration of 0.3ms which is fairly typical of blast loads. The peak pressure of our model is 25MPa (3630psi). In normal practice, the peak pressure is determined by considering the TNT-mass equivalency of the explosive and the stand-off distance. Our choice of the peak pressure (of 25MPa) was made by a numerical trial-and-error process by examining the effect of the peak pressure on the deformation of a tube-capillary specimen containing no liquid. The peak pressure was chosen to be a value that caused significant deformation of the tube but not complete crushing. This resulted in a choice of 25MPa as the peak pressure. The blast pressure of Fig. 14 was assumed to act uniformly on the upper surface of the top plate in Fig. 15
                        .

The geometry of the simulated test arrangement is shown in Fig. 15. The model consists of a bottom or base and an upper or top plate. The tube-capillary specimen is placed between the two plates. The bottom of the base is fixed while the top surface of the upper plate is subject to the pressure pulse of Fig. 14. Also seen in Fig. 15 is a rectangular box region surrounding the tube-capillary solid domain. This rectangular box is the Eulerian domain for the liquid in the problem. Only a quarter of the full model is shown in Fig. 15 because of the symmetry in the geometry and the loading.

The tube and capillary were assumed to be of the same material (1018 steel) as in the experiments and simulations described in Section 3. Both tube and capillary have the same inside diameters and wall-thicknesses as in the drop-weight tests. The base and top plates were identical in size (3in. by 3in. by 1in. or 7.62cm by 7.62cm by 2.54cm in Fig. 15). The Eulerian domain had dimensions of 200mm by 7.5mm by 15mm (7.87in. by 0.295in. by 0.591in.).

The steel tube was assigned the same material properties as in the drop-weight simulations described in Section 3. The rate-dependent elastic plastic model for the steel was as described in Eq. (2). The top plate and base were assumed to behave in a linear elastic manner with linear elastic properties corresponding to steel. The liquid in the tube and capillary was modeled in the same manner as in the simulations of the drop-weight tests. A Mie–Gruneisen equation of state was used for the pressure and a Newtonian viscous model was used for the deviatoric behavior. Most of the parameters of the model for the liquid in these simulated blast tests were identical with the values indicated in Table 1, except for the dynamic shear viscosity which was chosen to be a parameter and therefore allowed to vary over a wide range.

The top plate, base, and steel tube-capillary were modeled with hexahedral, linear, reduced integration elements. The elements in the Eulerian box were 8-node linear, Eulerian brick elements with reduced integration. A Coupled-Eulerian–Lagrangian approach was utilized again with the contact definitions between interacting solids and liquid identical with the drop-weight simulations. The problem was solved using the explicit dynamics solver in Abaqus 6.11. Post-processing was also similar to the drop-weight problem. In particular, the approach adopted to calculate the viscous dissipation energy in the viscous liquid was the same as described in Section 3.2.1.

The response of the liquid filled tube-capillary specimen depends on a number of material and geometry parameters. These include the properties of the liquid such as its dynamic shear viscosity (η), bulk modulus, and density

                            was set at 2.0. (The half-length of the tube was 15.0cm (6.0in.) and the capillary length was 7.5cm (3.0in.).) Two baseline simulations were performed: (a) an empty tube-capillary specimen and (b) a liquid filled tube-capillary specimen. For the simulation which included the liquid, the dynamic shear viscosity of the liquid was set at 10Pas (100Poise). The blast pressure of Fig. 14 was assumed to act uniformly on the upper surface of the top plate in Fig. 15, for both cases a and b. The results of the two simulations are presented next.

When an empty specimen is subject to a blast load, the principal energy dissipation mechanism is plastic deformation of the tube. For the baseline blast load of Fig. 14, the plastic energy absorbed by the deformation of the empty specimen is shown as a function of time in Fig. 16
                           . The pressure pulse, as shown in Fig. 14, peaks at 0.2ms and decays linearly to zero at 0.3ms. It can be seen in Fig. 16 that the bulk of the plastic deformation in the steel tube occurs somewhere between 0.3 and 0.5ms, after initiation of the pulse. The plastic energy absorbed reaches a peak value of 113J by 0.5ms and no further plastic deformation occurs in the remainder of the simulation time-frame (1.0ms).

When the tube is filled with a liquid of dynamic viscosity 10Pas (100Poise), energy can potentially be absorbed by two mechanisms. This is shown in Fig. 17
                           , where the plastic deformation energy and viscous dissipation energy are shown as functions of time elapsed in the simulated blast. The pressure pulse used was as shown in Fig. 14. The total energy dissipated (107J) is almost the same as the energy dissipated in the empty-tube simulation (Fig. 16), but the energy is partitioned between plastic deformation (86.9J) and viscous dissipation (19.7J). Fig. 18
                           (a) shows the maximum pressure generated within the tube in this simulation. Fig. 18(b) shows the maximum liquid flow velocity that is generated in the tube. The maximum velocity in this simulation is an order of magnitude larger than in the drop-weight test (Fig. 12(a)) which explains the significantly larger viscous dissipation energy. Also, the peak Reynolds number is less than 200 which is below the critical Reynolds number for turbulent flow, thus justifying the use of the Coupled-Eulerian–Lagrangian (CEL) approach in Abaqus 6.11 which relies on the existence of laminar flow for validity.

To investigate the influence of the peak magnitude of the pressure in the pressure-time blast pulse, the response of the liquid (viscosity 10Pas) filled tube to an enhanced pressure pulse was simulated. The enhanced pressure pulse had a peak magnitude of 30MPa (4350psi) as compared to the peak of 25MPa (3630psi) for the baseline pulse. The energy absorbed by the two mechanisms as a function of time is shown in Fig. 19
                           . As expected, the total energy absorbed is larger in comparison to the baseline pressure pulse. More interestingly, the fraction of the total energy absorbed by the viscous dissipation mechanism is larger too. The viscous dissipation mechanism comprises 27% of the total energy absorbed for the enhanced pressure pulse load as compared with 18.5% for the baseline pressure pulse load (Fig. 17).

It is apparent that the viscosity of the liquid should play a major role in the viscous-assist phenomenon. This was explored through a series of simulations of the tube-capillary specimen

                            subject to the baseline pressure pulse of Fig. 14. The viscosity of the liquid was varied over a range of discrete values (1–500Poise or 0.1–50Pas). The energies absorbed by the viscous and plastic deformation mechanisms as a function of viscosity are shown in Fig. 20
                           (a). As the viscosity is increased, the total viscous energy dissipated in the simulated blast response increases. The accompanying plastic energy absorption in the deforming steel tube decreases. This is a consequence of the stiffening effect that arises because the liquid is not easily propelled out of the capillaries because of the higher viscosity. But this drop in plastic deformation energy is compensated by an increase in viscous dissipation energy. As a result, the total energy absorbed is about the same for all viscosities, but the ratio of viscous energy to total energy absorbed increases with viscosity. For a viscosity of 0.1Pas, the ratio of viscous energy to total energy absorbed is 6.7%. For a viscosity of 50.0Pas, the ratio of viscous energy to total energy absorbed is 30%. Clearly, for blast-type loads, the viscous dissipation mechanism can be a significant contributor to the energy absorption process in a blast shield.

The capillary length was next considered as a parameter. With the viscosity set at 10Pas (100Poise), and all other parameters set at the baseline values, the capillary length was varied from 3.75cm (1.5in.) to 9.5cm (3.75in.). The length of the capillary in the baseline simulations reported in Section 4.3.1 was 7.5cm (3.0in.) which corresponded to an

                            ratio corresponding to all choices was 4.0, 2.7, 2.0, and 1.6.

As can be seen from the results shown in Fig. 20(b), the impact of the capillary length was small for the lengths chosen in this study. The total energy dissipated and the partitioning into viscous dissipation and plastic deformation is not significantly different for the four different lengths chosen. However it is possible that for significantly different lengths than the ones chosen for study here, the results could differ.

A method to improve energy absorption and minimize damage caused by blast and impact loads on protection panels was considered in this work. The approach taken was to augment the energy absorbed by plastic deformation in metal sandwich panels by inducing a second mechanism of viscous dissipation by forcing a viscous liquid to flow through narrow channels and capillaries. This concept of a viscous assist to the energy absorption in protection panels was explored primarily through finite element simulations. Our investigations focused on a simple tube-capillary specimen filled with a viscous liquid. These specimens were subject to experimental and numerically simulated drop-weight tests as well as numerically simulated blast tests.

Drop-weight impact experiments were conducted on empty and liquid-filled tube-capillary specimens using an instrumented drop-weight test apparatus. The drop-weight tests were also simulated using Coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian (CEL) finite element simulations, in order to capture the fluid structure interaction in the deforming liquid-filled specimen. The simulations and experiments revealed that the plastic deformation energy absorbed by the metal in the liquid-filled specimens was smaller than the plastic energy absorbed by the empty specimens. This was due to the higher stiffness of the liquid-filled specimens, which caused some of the energy delivered by the falling weight to be re-directed as rebound kinetic energy of the striker. The CEL simulations of the liquid-filled specimens showed that the liquid flow speeds generated in the specimens by the impact of the drop-weight were small, and as a result the viscous dissipation energy was negligible. The primary conclusion from the experimental drop-weight tests and simulations of these tests was that the liquid flow speeds generated in the test specimens by weight-drops were inadequate to produce measurable viscous dissipation energy. Consequently, the predominant mechanism of energy absorption in these tests was one of plastic deformation in the metal tubes. Higher liquid flow speeds would have to be generated through more rapid deformation speeds in order to produce non-negligible viscous energy dissipation.

CEL simulations of the liquid-filled tube-capillary specimens, subject to pressure pulses resembling a blast load, showed that much higher liquid flow speeds could be achieved in the specimens, thus generating non-negligible viscous energy dissipation in addition to the plastic deformation energy of the metal tubes. A parametric study was performed to examine the effect of key parameters such as the dynamic shear viscosity of the liquid and the effect of the ratio of the length of the tube to the length of the capillary. The dynamic shear viscosity of the liquid was determined to be a key parameter having a major effect on the fraction of viscous dissipation energy to the total energy absorbed. For the range of viscosities explored, the fraction of viscous to total energy dissipated ranged from 7% to 30%. The length of the capillary had a much smaller impact on the viscous dissipation energy, for the range of lengths explored in this study. The magnitude of the peak pressure in a blast too has an effect. The greater the peak pressure magnitude, the greater the overall energy absorbed by the liquid-filled tube-capillary specimens and the greater the fraction of viscous energy dissipated. Results of these simulations of blast tests of tube-capillary specimens will be verified by experimental testing in the near future.

The results of this study indicate that the concept of viscous-assist can be utilized for protective armor panels and structures. Viscous energy dissipation can provide an additional mechanism for energy absorption in these applications, and can therefore provide increased protection and reduced damage.
