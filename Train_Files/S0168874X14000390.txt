                  We introduce a new framework for the development of hybrid stress finite elements for two-dimensional linear elasticity. A family of arbitrarily shaped elements is derived which takes advantage of the special structure of this framework. The key feature is to explicitly approximate, in the parent domain, either the second Piola–Kirchhoff, the first Piola–Kirchhoff, or the Cauchy stresses, and to enforce the divergence-free condition in the physical domain using their corresponding first Piola–Kirchhoff projections. The introduced finite elements may have arbitrary curved edges, and internally satisfy in strong form the equilibrium differential equations. Furthermore, under certain conditions, the new elements may lead to statically admissible stress distributions, by also verifying equilibrium of tractions on the element boundaries. Feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed elements are numerically verified through several benchmark tests.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Hybrid stress finite elements were first introduced by Pian and his co-workers in the mid 1960s in the framework of the two-dimensional linear elasticity theory [1–4]. Since then, they have experienced significant developments and have been successfully applied to many engineering problems. For a comprehensive review on these formulations the reader is referred to [5]. More recent research developments can be found e.g. in [6–8]. The main advantages of these elements over traditional displacement-based finite elements are faster convergence, higher stress accuracy, and immunity to numerical locking. Special families of these elements are the so-called equilibrium elements [9–11], which can provide statically admissible stress distributions. Pairing these solutions with kinematically admissible ones allows us to obtain strict bounds of the error, both in terms of energy and local quantities of interest [9–13]. However, the need to enforce equilibrium on the stress approximation basis imposes severe geometric restrictions on traditional hybrid equilibrium elements. To avoid these limitations, a new hybrid equilibrium method based on the approximation of the contravariant components of the stress tensor defined in the parent domain was presented by the authors in [14,15]. This new method can be used to obtain statically admissible solutions for element geometries with arbitrarily curved edges, even with a small number of elements and relatively low degree approximations.

The present work follows that line of research, and introduces a new framework for the development of hybrid stress finite elements. Additionally, a family of arbitrarily shaped elements is derived which takes advantage of the special structure of this framework. The variational setting of this framework relies on a hybrid form of the well known complementary energy functional, involving both stress fields and boundary displacements as fundamental variables. The key feature is to explicitly approximate the stresses (second Piola–Kirchhoff, first Piola–Kirchhoff, or Cauchy stresses) in a local reference system and to enforce the divergence-free condition using their corresponding first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses. The first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses are computed using the Piola transformation that maps stresses from the parent domain to the physical domain using the Jacobian matrix associated with the corresponding geometric mapping. The Piola transformation is employed in this work in the context of a tensor-field mapping. The application of the Piola transformation in the context of a vector-field mapping has been recently considered in [16]. The proposed procedure leads to Cauchy stresses that satisfy a priori the equilibrium differential equations inside elements with a general mapping and, under certain conditions, may lead to statically admissible stress distributions. Several numerical benchmark tests will be presented to assess the performance of the new elements.

We emphasize that the Piola transformation is used in the present work to map stresses from the parent domain to the physical (undeformed) domain, and not from the undeformed domain to the deformed domain, as is typically the case in the non-linear elasticity framework. Therefore, the various stress measures adopted in the paper, namely, Cauchy, first Piola–Kirchhoff and second Piola–Kirchhoff stresses, well known from the non-linear continuum mechanics theory, are not related by the actual geometric mapping of the elements from the undeformed to the deformed configurations, but rather by the geometric mapping from the master element to the physical (undeformed) element. In the same way, the deformation gradient is used in this work as the Jacobian matrix associated with the geometric mapping from the master element to the physical (undeformed) element and it does not represent any physical deformation measure of the elements. Although the proposed elements have been developed exclusively for linear elasticity problems, we believe the use of these nomenclatures will make the extension to the non-linear elasticity setting more straightforward.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we state the boundary-value problem and present some of its associated variational formulations. In Section 3 we introduce the Piola transformation and show how it can be employed in the framework of the present problem to determine divergence-free stress fields. The proposed Piola–Kirchhoff hybrid stress finite elements are then thoroughly described in Section 4. Some practical aspects for the computational implementation of the new elements are briefly described in Section 5. Finally, we present some numerical results in Section 6 and state the fundamental conclusions that can be drawn from this work in Section 7.

The process involved in the formulation of the proposed elements is analogous to that used for the development of other hybrid stress elements, see e.g. 
                     [11], which are a generalization of the equilibrium elements developed by Fraeijs de Veubeke [9,10]. The stresses are independently approximated in each element such that they locally verify (1b). The inter-element equilibrium is weakly enforced a posteriori, and, under certain conditions, it results satisfied in strong form. The governing system of equations imposes, in weak form, compatibility of the corresponding strains.

In the framework of the present work, stresses are taken as the fundamental approximate field variables. As it will be shown later on, the adopted stress approximation, either second Piola–Kirchhoff, first Piola–Kirchhoff or Cauchy representation, plays an essential role in the performance of the developed finite elements. We will study the formulations associated with each of these three stress approximations. In all cases we start with a complete polynomial basis which, in general, is not divergence-free.

The first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses are obtained from the stress approximations using the adequate transformation. The conditions leading to a divergence-free basis are then determined for the specific geometry of each element using the equilibrium differential equations (15).

The general framework will be introduced in the present section, whereas the most relevant implementation aspects will be presented in Section 5.

As mentioned above, the key aspect of the proposed finite element formulation is to adopt either the second Piola–Kirchhoff, the first Piola–Kirchhoff, or the Cauchy stress vectors as the fundamental approximate stress fields. This obviously leads to three different finite element formulations.

We therefore use one of the following approximations for the stress vectors within an element:

                         is the vector of displacement parameters associated with edge j. These approximations are independently defined on each edge, unlike what is commonly adopted in most hybrid stress finite element formulations. This allows us to strictly enforce inter-element equilibrium.

The final expression for the discretized hybrid complementary energy will depend on the selected stress approximations, i.e., on whether we adopt the approximate Cauchy stress vector as given by (21), (22) or (23). We therefore define the discrete version of the hybrid complementary energy in the following general form:

Simple direct allocation operations on the elementary systems of equations are needed to set up the assembled system for the finite element mesh, as described in [11]. The assembled system presents the same symmetric structure as the corresponding elementary systems.

The global vectors 
                           s
                         and 
                           q
                         collect the elementary stress parameters,

                        , and the boundary displacement parameters, 
                           
                              
                                 q

                        , respectively. The assembled flexibility matrix, F, is sparse diagonal, and the assembled inter-element equilibrium matrix, A, is also block sparse.

In a row of A, which expresses equilibrium on a given edge, the only non-zero contributions correspond to stress parameters of the elements that are adjacent to that edge.

As mentioned in [11], the governing system can be condensed taking advantage of the positive definite nature and of the block diagonal structure of F. By doing so, the dimension of the global system becomes equal to the number of boundary displacement parameters.

The new elements were implemented in a

                      code [17], where the expansions of polynomial expressions, as for example in Eqs. (34) and (42), were automatically generated. This was achieved by processing the general analytical formulas in a

                      code [18], which directly produces the required Matlab subroutines.

Finite elements of triangular and quadrilateral shapes can be used, based on the usual master geometries represented in Fig. 2
                        . Only linear or quadratic and bi-linear or bi-quadratic transformations were implemented to perform the mapping from the parent element to the physical element, but the extension to other polynomial transformations is straightforward.

The Cartesian coordinates are expressed as functions of the local coordinates by

                        , which requires

                        . For quadrilaterals we use the product of complete bases in ξ
                        1 and ξ
                        2. This leads to an approximation which, when expressed in terms of the monomials, verifies

                        . In both cases we limit the projection of the approximation function along an edge of the parent element to be a polynomial of, at most, degree

It is possible to express the approximations of the coordinates as functions of nodal values by using the standard two-dimensional elements, T3, T6, T10, T15, …, for triangles and Q4, Q8, Q9, Q16, …, for quadrilaterals. Nevertheless, we note that the main advantage of this choice – a simple physical interpretation of the nodal variables – is lost when the basis is constrained to become self-equilibrated.

As previously mentioned, the stresses are approximated independent of each element and need to satisfy the equilibrium equations pointwise within each element. To accomplish this, we developed a new framework that makes use of the Piola transformation to map the approximated stresses onto equilibrated stresses. The proposed framework takes advantage of the polynomial nature of the resulting equilibrium conditions, which can be locally satisfied if they are imposed for the coefficients that multiply each monomial. The steps involved in this procedure are detailed in the following.

We first define our approximations for the stress vectors within an element using one of the following approximations:

For a linear coordinate mapping,

                         is constant. In this case, the transformations (22) and (23) do not affect the degree of the approximations. Therefore, for the same approximation basis for stresses, the three alternative formulations lead to equivalent function spaces.

For triangular elements, which use a complete basis, and are, therefore, invariant under a linear transformation, the approximation spaces are equivalent to the ones employed in the usual hybrid equilibrium approach [11], where the Cauchy stresses are expressed in terms of the Cartesian coordinates. In this case, the number of self-equilibrated stress modes is

For quadrilateral elements, an incomplete basis is used. In this case, the basis is not invariant under a rigid body rotation and, therefore, even for a linear coordinate mapping, the approximation in terms of local coordinates is not equivalent, in general, to a similar basis defined in Cartesian coordinates. This can be realized by considering an element under a rotation which is not multiple of 
                           π
                           /

                        . While, in this new framework, the stress approximations along the element sides remain functions of degree d
                        
                           hef
                        , in the standard hybrid equilibrium approach the stress approximations have degree up to

As no analytical procedure was devised to obtain, for a general non-linear coordinate mapping, the number of self-equilibrated stress modes in an element, a numerical study was carried out to obtain some insight into this information. In this study we varied the position of the nodes of an element, so that they correspond to sane geometries, checking the corresponding number of modes obtained using the procedure described in Section 5.2. The obtained results are presented in Tables 2–4
                        
                        
                        , along with the number of self-equilibrated stress modes used in the hybrid equilibrium formulation, n
                        
                           hef

                         for parallelograms, although it is reduced by 2 for different element shapes. Finally, when considering the approximation of 
                           S
                        , three different cases were observed for

                           3
                        . More specifically, for parallelograms, we obtained the same number of self-equilibrated stress modes as in the case of 
                           P
                         and 
                           σ
                        . The number of self-equilibrated stress modes obtained for parallelograms is reduced differently when the elements have only two parallel sides or not.

For elements with higher-order coordinate mappings, the relation between the element shape and the number of self-equilibrated stress modes becomes more involving. In this case, we opt to just list the number of self-equilibrated stress modes obtained in the tests. The characterization of the conditions under which they occur is beyond the scope of this work.

Finally, we note that, as lower-order coordinate mappings are special cases of higher-order ones, all results in Table 2 are present in Table 4. Similarly, when triangular elements are considered, the results obtained for n
                        
                           hef

The system of equations obtained by assembling (28) for all elements in a mesh may be singular. Clearly, since the flexibility matrix of each element,

If 
                           f
                         is orthogonal to a non-empty null space of

                        , then the system of equations exists, but is not unique, i.e. the displacement parameters in the null space of 
                           
                              
                                 A
                              
                              
                                 T
                              
                           
                         can take arbitrary values. However, the solution in terms of the stress parameters is unique.

A distinction is made between eventual rigid body modes of the domain, normally blocked if appropriate kinematic boundary conditions are imposed, and the remaining members of the null space, usually termed spurious kinematic modes (skm׳s). The condition for the admissibility of 
                           f
                         associated with the rigid body modes implies global equilibrium of the applied loads, while the admissibility condition associated with an skm requires that the loading can be represented by the approximated stresses. This can be illustrated by considering one element with a free right angle corner where different shear tractions are applied, which represents a stress state that cannot be represented by the assumed continuous stress distribution.

                        , the conditions under which these skm׳s may occur were already characterized in [19] for an isolated element, and in [20] for assemblies of triangular elements with linear sides. Given the aforementioned equivalences, the same conditions apply to our hybrid triangular elements with linear geometry.

Triangular elements with a quadratic geometry are also affected by a reduction of the number of self-equilibrated stress modes as indicated in Table 3.

The numerical results presented in Section 6, which are only a part of a larger set of tests that were performed, show that meshes of triangular elements with a regular quadratic approximation of the geometry are free from skm׳s when the first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses are approximated and the following condition holds

                                 v
                              
                           
                        . An approximation degree higher than 3 is generally sufficient. The increase in the minimum degree of approximation required to avoid skm׳s with respect to the hybrid equilibrium formulation can be explained by the decrease of the number of modes observed from columns 5–2 in Table 3. The different behaviours obtained when the other stress approximations are used may be explained by the smaller number of modes that they can represent for the same degree. In any case, this approximation may not imply a strict enforcement of equilibrium, as discussed in the following section.

For quadrilateral elements with a bi-linear geometry mapping, the situation is significantly more complex. On one hand, meshes of the corresponding quadrilateral hybrid equilibrium elements normally have skm׳s. On the other hand, the use of different approximation spaces leads necessarily to solutions with different characteristics, usually with fewer self-equilibrated stress modes. The proposed framework solves the problem of having approximations that depend on the reference frame used, but, as for triangular elements, potentially increases the number of skm׳s by decreasing the number of self-equilibrated stress modes. In the numerical tests performed a variation of d
                        
                           v
                         was always considered. From the analysis of the obtained results we propose a rule of thumb which generally leads to results without spurious kinematic modes: 
                           
                              
                                 d
                              
                              
                                 v
                              
                           
                           =

                                 Ψ
                              
                           
                           −

                        .

It is not the goal of the present work to present the mathematical proofs of convergence, but rather to introduce the formulations and to give some practical (numerical) guidelines for their convergence. The necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence are governed by the Babuska–Brezzi conditions, as is always the case for hybrid/mixed finite element formulations. From a numerical point of view, these conditions are guaranteed as long as no spurious modes are present in the discrete problem. Although these conditions have already been studied in [20] for triangular elements with straight edges, further studies will be needed for the determination of the stability conditions of the proposed elements with curved edges.

We note however that, even when spurious kinematic modes exist, convergence of the stresses is always achieved whenever the loads are admissible, whereas the boundary displacements do not converge since they are not uniquely defined.

Another alternative, which may be considered in the future, is to approximate various stress fields simultaneously. This requires an additional step for the removal of linearly dependent approximations, which can be implemented using, for instance, a procedure similar to the one described in Section 5.2, by taking advantage of the polynomial nature of the first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses for all the approximations considered. The functions in such an approximation space would obviously be included in a higher-order basis for 
                           P
                        , but we conjecture that this approach may provide sufficient information, without requiring a much larger basis.

For all triangular hybrid equilibrium elements with linear geometry, the imposition of the weak form of boundary equilibrium (27b) implies that the strong form is also verified since both the boundary tractions and the displacements belong to the same space of polynomial functions.

As stated in the previous section, for triangular elements with a quadratic geometry, the most promising approach corresponds to approximating the first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses. Nevertheless, we note that, in this case, the variation of the Cauchy stresses on the boundary is described by a rational function, because of the term 
                           1
                           /
                           J
                        . The tractions have an additional complexity, because the normal vector is also a rational function.

As will be shown in Section 6.3, in practical problems with regular geometries, particularly for high

                        , the tractions can be exactly balanced. For irregular geometries, or when d
                        
                           v
                         is slightly lower than

                        , the lack of equilibrium introduced has no significant effect on the stress distribution and, therefore, the obtained solutions may be termed “quasi-equilibrated”.

To validate and assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid stress elements, some benchmark problems are analyzed and their solutions compared with those obtained using hybrid equilibrium elements. The obtained results are also compared with the exact analytical solutions when they exist. Only the results associated with solutions corresponding to residuals of less than 10−12 have been indicated.

All meshes and stress plots presented were generated using gmsh 
                     [21].

Several other problems proposed in the literature were tested. Among these, we mention for instance the beam in pure bending problem studied in [22]. The corresponding results are not presented in this work, since problems where the exact stress fields can be represented by a polynomial stress basis are solved exactly using the proposed formulation. In the case of the beam in pure bending problem, the horizontal stress field is linear in the vertical direction. Therefore, our formulation is capable of exactly reproducing it, simply by using a linear first Piola–Kirchhoff stress basis.

The patch test was performed for the 5-element mesh proposed by Robinson and Blackham [23] under plane stress conditions, see Fig. 3
                        . The geometrical and material data were taken as a=0.12, b=0.24,

                        . The coordinates of the inner nodes of the patch are

                           )
                        .

The obtained results indicate that the three constant stress states can be reproduced exactly only if we select either the first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses or the Cauchy stresses as the fundamental approximate variables. It is worth noting however that, in case we select the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress approximations, the stress components must be at least of order one, so that the constant Cauchy stresses can be retrieved. In other words, both the first Piola–Kirchhoff and the Cauchy stress approximations include the three constant Cauchy stress modes on their bases, in the former case if at least linear stresses are employed, whereas the second Piola–Kirchhoff approximation does not. The reason for this is that, when using polynomial functions to approximate the second Piola–Kirchhoff stresses, the resulting Cauchy stresses come out as rational functions, and therefore do not contain the constant stresses.

The results rendered by the proposed formulation with the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress approximation are displayed in Table 5
                        . The displayed results correspond to the stress errors defined as

                         displays the norms of the residuals of the solutions of the governing system of equations assembled from (28).

The contour plots of σ
                        11 obtained using two different sets of second Piola–Kirchhoff stress/displacement approximations, more specifically, second Piola–Kirchhoff stresses of degree 4 and displacements of degree 2, and second Piola–Kirchhoff stresses of degree 8 and displacements of degree 6, are shown in Fig. 4
                        . As can be seen, although the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress approximation does not pass the patch test, as the approximation degrees are consistently increased, an increasingly accurate approximation of the constant stress mode in the x
                        1-direction is obtained. Further investigation into the response of the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress formulation will be given in Section 6.3 through the analysis of a thick cylinder problem. As it will be seen, although this formulation does not pass the patch test, it still produces fairly accurate solutions if appropriate combinations of stress/displacement approximations are selected.

Conventional displacement-based finite element formulations for 2D plane strain problems fail when Poisson׳s ratio approaches 0.5, i.e., when the material becomes incompressible. This phenomenon is referred in the literature to as incompressible (or volumetric) locking. The displacement fields may be inaccurately computed and highly oscillatory stresses may be obtained. There have been many attempts to suppress or at least alleviate locking, see e.g. 
                        [24]. Hybrid stress finite element methods are known to naturally overcome incompressible locking [25], as they use the flexibility form of the constitutive relations.

In order to ascertain the sensitivity of the proposed finite element formulation to incompressible locking, the 5-element mesh was analyzed considering plane strain conditions. No deterioration of either the displacements or the stresses was found even for a Poisson׳s ratio of 0.5.

We have performed the same type of numerical test to all the remaining examples and no deterioration of the obtained results was found as well. This indicates that, as is commonly the case of hybrid stress formulations, the present finite element formulation is not sensitive to incompressible locking.

The Cook׳s membrane problem was first introduced in [26] and has been widely used since then as a benchmark test to check the performance of finite element formulations. This is a classical bending dominated test consisting of a tapered panel clamped on one side and subject to a shear load on the opposite side. The two other sides are traction-free. The geometry, loading and boundary conditions are given in Fig. 5
                        . The shear load is taken to be parabolic, with resultant F, as depicted in Fig. 5. This is assumed in order to avoid the load induced singularities at the right-hand corners, which are introduced by uniform shear distributions. We note that such singularities cannot be locally equilibrated by a continuous stress field and, therefore, meshes of equilibrium finite elements where only one element is present at the corner cannot solve the problem, i.e. the uniform load is inadmissible for such meshes.

We are particularly interested in studying the convergence of the following quantities: (i) vertical displacement at the middle of the right-hand side of the panel, v
                        
                           C
                        , (ii) maximum principal stress at the midpoint of the bottom side, σ
                        
                           max
                        
                        
                           A
                        , and (iii) minimum principal stress at the midpoint of the top side, σ
                        
                           min
                        
                        
                           B
                        , as indicated in Fig. 5. The membrane is assumed to be under plane stress conditions.

The adopted refinement scheme consists of “uniform” refinements of the non-uniform regular mesh obtained by splitting the membrane into four quadrilaterals, as illustrated in Fig. 5.

The reference solutions were obtained using triangular hybrid equilibrium elements of degree 5 on a non-uniform mesh with 4504 elements, which was adaptively refined using the procedure described in [27]. For the parabolic shear load the obtained reference solutions are

We first consider a p-refinement study of the membrane on the 4×4 mesh, i.e., using different stress and displacement approximations. In this case, we have only adopted the first Piola–Kirchhoff stress approximation. The obtained results for v

                         along with the initial configuration of the membrane. The deformed configurations were constructed using the displacements obtained for the edges of the elements. We note that, although the solutions are not strictly compatible, i.e., the inter-element displacements are not continuous at the element vertices, the discontinuities tend to zero with increasing approximation degrees.

We finally perform an h-refinement study. The selected degrees for stresses and displacements are 4 and 2, respectively. The obtained results for v

                        . As it can be seen, the results are converging to the reference solutions. For the sake of comparison, the solutions obtained using standard isoparametric displacement-based elements are also indicated in the table.

The equivalence between the three proposed formulations and the hybrid stress equilibrium formulation [11] for meshes of triangular elements with a linear geometry was numerically checked in this problem. The same results were produced by all formulations at least up to the 6th figure. We attribute the non-perfect matching of the results to numerical integration and round-off errors.

The analysis of a thick-walled elastic cylinder subjected to internal pressure is carried out in this section. This problem has the advantage that closed-form solutions exist for the stresses and displacements. Due to symmetry conditions, only a quarter of the cylinder is analyzed. The cylinder geometry, loading and boundary conditions are given in Fig. 8
                        . The cylinder is assumed to be under a plane strain state. The geometrical, material and loading parameters are taken in this case as R

The adopted finite element mesh consists of bi-quadratic triangular elements as shown in Fig. 8. We note that, since we are using a fixed mesh of triangular elements with bi-quadratic geometry, we cannot exactly represent the circular edges. Therefore, our numerical solutions are not converging to the exact solution of the problem under analysis. Hence, regardless of the selected stress/displacement approximation degrees, the errors with respect to the exact solution will never converge to zero.

The complementary strain energies obtained using the three stress approximations are presented in Table 11
                        . Clearly, the results produced by the formulation based on the approximation of the first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses are more accurate than those rendered by the formulations based on the second Piola–Kirchhoff or Cauchy stresses. Notably, although the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress formulation does not pass the patch test, it still renders fairly accurate results.

                        .

The horizontal and vertical equilibrium defaults on the tractions, obtained with the first Piola–Kirchhoff approximations of degree 4 and displacements of degree 3 for the inner and outer boundaries represented in Fig. 8, are shown in Fig. 10
                        . As can be seen, these equilibrium defaults are non-zero, with values below 0.001, much smaller than the stresses involved, which have values around unity. In this example, for boundary displacements of degree 4, the equilibrium defaults are of the order of magnitude of the round-off error, i.e. the solution is strictly equilibrated.

As mentioned before, the quadratic geometry approximation used by the proposed formulation introduces an error in the representation of the circular domain. This is inconvenient for convergence studies, as either a p- or an h-refinement scheme used in the framework of the isoparametric displacement elements simultaneously reduces the errors in the solution and geometry. Hence, in order to isolate the convergence characteristics of the finite element solution, a modified problem is considered. More specifically, we consider a quadratic geometry such that the free edges are normal to the sliding supports, thus removing a potential singularity. This geometry is given by

                        and it can be exactly represented by all the adopted elements. This allows us to directly compare the results obtained with the new elements against those produced by the standard displacement-based elements, as both types of elements can exactly reproduce a quadratic geometry. We note that, unlike the isoparametric displacement elements, the proposed elements are associated with a fixed geometry when a p-refinement scheme is considered.

                           =
                           45
                           °
                        . The initial mesh of triangles consists of eight elements, corresponding to the subdivision of each quadrilateral into four elements. A quadratic mapping is applied to all elements, i.e., edges that are not radial are quadratic in all cases. The maximum element size h is the length of the element sides on the outer edge. The reference value considered for the strain energy is 0.402956325945, which, for the given precision, is a converged solution.

The convergence results are given in Figs. 11 and 12
                        
                        . As it can be seen, the hybrid stress elements are “comparable” in terms of convergence rates to their displacement counterparts when the approximations of the Piola–Kirchhoff stress elements are one degree higher than the approximations of the isoparametric displacement elements.

In this example, we analyze an infinite plate with a circular hole under constant in-plane tension at infinity, a problem with exact analytical solution, see e.g.

The deformed configuration of the plate computed using first Piola–Kirchhoff stresses of degree 4 and displacements of degree 2 on the last mesh of Fig. 14 is depicted in Fig. 16
                         along with the initial configuration of the plate. The deformed configurations were constructed using the displacements obtained for the edges of the elements. We note that, although the solution obtained is not strictly compatible, i.e., the numerical displacements are not continuous at the element vertices, the discontinuities are so small that cannot be detected at the adopted scale.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We have introduced a new framework for the development of hybrid stress finite elements with arbitrary curved edges. This framework makes use of a Piola transformation that maps stresses from parent space to physical space. Three alternative formulations based on this framework have been proposed, more specifically, the first and second Piola–Kirchhoff formulations and the Cauchy formulation. The three formulations employ divergence-free stress approximations. The obtained numerical results confirm that, as a consequence of using the flexibility format of the constitutive relations, the three formulations are free from incompressible locking when Poisson׳s ratio reaches 0.5. The numerical results also showed that, while the first Piola–Kirchhoff and Cauchy formulations satisfy both the constant and linear stress patch tests, the second Piola–Kirchhoff formulation does not. Further research studies are required to determine the conditions for static admissibility, as well as mathematical proofs of the numerical stability of the new elements. Further research studies are required to determine the conditions for static admissibility, numerically verified in this work for curved triangular elements, as well as the mathematical proofs for the numerical stability of the new elements. The computational cost of the proposed approach is similar to that of other hybrid stress approaches, with the additional cost, although linear in the dimension of the problem, of performing independent SVD׳s that depend on the geometry of each element.It is our goal to extend this new framework to both elastodynamics and non-linear elastostatics.
