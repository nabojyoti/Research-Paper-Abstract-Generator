                  In this manuscript a finite element (FE) investigation of soil–blade interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic–plastic material with the non-associated Drucker–Prager constitutive law. A separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in detail. The procedure uses a separation criterion that becomes active at consecutive nodes on the predefined separation surfaces. In order to mimic soil–blade sliding and soil–soil cutting phenomena contact elements with different properties are applied. Only rectangular shape blades are used in the simulation in order to verify the methodology by comparing the FE results with available analytical predictions, and examine the model׳s convergence. It is believed that the approach presented can be used to investigate the soil–tool interactions of real and more complex blade geometries and soil conditions and ultimately for improving design of blades used in tillage operations.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

According to [1], about half of energy used for crop production in farming is consumed by tillage operation because of high draft force generated when breaking and loosening of the soil occur. Most soil–blade interaction research [2] were focused on developing models to predict the draft force for different soil conditions, tool geometry, and operating parameters such as depth of operation, tool direction, etc. Rather significant effects of these conditions and parameters on the force prediction have been demonstrated experimentally in several research works [3–6].

Analytical considerations of soil–blade interaction are typically restricted to straight blades and are based on a simplified limit analysis. Nevertheless, when combined with experimental findings, they are widely used in design. The resulting formulas defining forces on blades during tillage operation can be found in [7] for two dimensional problems, and in [8] for three dimensional problems.

The blade shape obviously affects the form and size of the soil failure zone and consequently forces on the blade. Therefore, blades of more complicated geometries should be considered in optimization of the tillage operation. In particular, it is known that curved blades work better than straight blades. However, as already mentioned, any prediction of forces using analytical models would be limited to only a straight rectangular blade shape, and therefore not particularly useful in improving efficiency of tillage operations.

The FE method has obviously a potential of modeling the interaction between soil and blades of arbitrary shapes and to find the blade force during this interaction. Also, such techniques can be used to obtain information about the failure zone, field of stress, soil deformation, acting forces, etc. for any condition of soil. Several models based on FE to simulate soil–tool interaction and to obtain response of tools during these interactions have been presented in [9–18].

Two major challenges to be considered in the FE approach are the mechanical behavior of soil and the criteria for soil separation due to the cutting action of the blade [19]. Several models were proposed for simulating the constitutive law for soil; one of them is the Drucker–Prager model that assumes a non-associated elastic plastic behavior [1]. From the numerical viewpoint soil separation is somewhat similar to the problem of cutting chips in machining operations [20–22], where various geometrical and physical separation criteria were developed based on critical values of displacements, strains, stresses, or strain energy to estimate the beginning of separation. A new criterion that uses the limit compacting strains in the direction of cutting is proposed here. When using this criterion to the FE model the soil particles are separated ‘discretely’ at consecutive nodes starting from the node that is nearest to the cutting edge of the blade.

The overall objective of this research work is to develop a simulation procedure for modeling the soil–tool interaction for arbitrary shape of the blade. Here the proposed procedure is tested on the straight blades in order to compare it with available analytical/experimental results [7–8]. In particular, the use of contact elements, modeling sliding and cutting as the blade moves through the soil is explained in detail, as well as the method of calculating the draft force for the separation process that in fact takes place discretely at successive nodes.

The soil selected for this study is the type of soil commonly found in Saskatchewan. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, theoretical background and FE modeling is explained, Section 3 provides results and discussion, and Section 4 is the conclusion.

In this section, first the plasticity based constitutive law for soil is briefly outlined. Then the FE modeling and handling of the soil–blade interaction is explained. In particular, the procedure of simulating the cutting process (which is continuous) through the soil (described by a discrete FE mesh) is discussed in more details.

The material behavior in the theory of plasticity is governed by the yielding function (or the yield criterion) and the plastic flow rule typically derived from the plastic potential. If the plastic potential is the same as the yield function, then the plastic flow rule is called associated, with the increments of plastic strains normal to the yield surface. Otherwise, the flow rule is called non-associated with the direction of increments of plastic strains normal to the surface representing the plastic potential, but not to the yield function.

Drucker–Prager and Mohr–Coulomb are the two most commonly used failure criteria for soil in a plastic stress–strain region. There is a main difference between these two criteria which makes Drucker–Prager a preferred criterion in soil analysis: the Mohr–Coulomb criterion is difficult to use for plastic finite element analysis in 3D, since it is not a smooth continuous function, and has several sharp corners. On the other hand, the Drucker–Prager criterion has a conical surface in 3D and has smooth surface which is more suitable to be used.

The Drucker–Prager yield function (also referred to as extended/modified Drucker–Prager criteria, for example in [23]) is pressure dependent, which makes it applicable for geotechnical materials. It can be expressed as follows:

                         is dependent on the internal friction through the relationship

In this research, the soil–blade interaction is modeled by the Drucker–Prager criteria with a non-associate flow rule controlled by the value of dilatancy angle 
                           ν
                        , which represents the volumetric expansion and frictional-dilatancy behavior of the material. If there is no volumetric expansion, then 
                           ν
                           =
                           0
                         (shear type of deformation only), which corresponds the direction 3 (vertical) of the increments of plastic strain. On the other hand, for the flow rule associated with criterion (1) the increments of plastic strains would have direction 1 that contains shear deformation and dilatations characterized by the dilatancy angle 
                           ν
                           =
                           ϕ
                        . According to [19] for real materials angle 
                           ν
                         is usually less than 
                           ϕ
                         and should be within the limits 
                           0
                           <
                           ν
                           <
                           ϕ
                         as indicated by direction 2 (the values of parameters used in the paper are listed in 
                        Table 1).

In the numerical analysis with the external load increasing a typical material behavior defined by this law is plotted with dotted curve. It starts with elastic deformations until the yield criterion is reached and then the curve lines up with the yield surface (points 
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 i
                              
                           
                         are on this surface). Plastic deformations generated along the yield surface may be considered as compacting.

It should be noted that the yield criterion is not related to separation, which should be defined independently (but the stresses must be on the yield surface for the separation to happen). Since the separation status in FE can only be defined at nodes, the simulated separation process is ‘discrete’ in this sense that there would be some stress relieve when the status at a particular node is changed from initially connected to separated. For example if just before the first separation the stress state is defined by 
                           
                              
                                 T
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                         then just after separation it will be lowered and back in the elastic region. In this region the highest stress state, defined by 
                           
                              
                                 B

                        , will be typically at the opening׳s tip, i.e., at the node to be separated next. Then after a further load increase (controlled here by the forced blade׳s displacement) the stress state is observed at the node that would separate next. This stress state must first reach the yield surface again and then followed it until arriving at point 
                           
                              
                                 T

                         where the separation criterion is met again. After separating at the subsequent node the stress state drops to

                        , and so on (points

                        .. are further interpreted and discussed in Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 and shown in Figs. 6 and 7). Therefore in the FE analysis the constitutive law for soil being cut is represented to be a line coinciding with the yield line and elastic ‘incisions’ inwards (

                         in Fig. 1). This elastic line is representing separation at the consecutive nodal point. More details of the separation procedure are explained in the next section after the geometry of the FE model and the separation surfaces are presented.

As mentioned in Section 1, the type of soil used in this research is sandy clay loam soil, which is commonly found in Saskatchewan farms. The soil behavior and subsequent modeling will depend on the soil properties; however the effects of soil volume changes cannot be neglected. As mentioned in [24], based on relative motion among soil particle during soil deformation, volumetric changes should be considered for soil modeling and any prediction of soil behavior. In FE modeling, this volume change behavior is controlled by the dilatancy angle which varies by soil density and its packing pressure. The typical range of dilatancy angle for granular soil is between 12° and −20° [25]. As shown in Table 1, in this research paper based on high density of soil and low packing pressure, the dilatancy angle is set at 20°.

The properties of soil as given by [26] and steel blade that are used in this study are listed in Table 1. The elastic–plastic behavior of soil is completely defined by cohesion, internal friction angle, dilatancy angle, modulus of elasticity, specific weight, and Poisson׳s ratio. It should be mentioned that the water content has a significant effect on the soil cohesion which results from electrostatic bonds between soil particles. By increasing water content of soil, lubricating effect of moisture layers on soil particles increases, which will result in decreasing particular tensile resistance, and consequently decreasing soil cohesion [27]. The results will be affected by changing the properties of soil especially cohesion and internal friction angle and would be different if the values were different.

In the FE general 3D model both soil and blade are represented by the hexahedral elements SOLID45 from the ANSYS [23] library of elements, which have 8 nodes and 3 degree of freedoms (DOF) at each node. The soil–blade connection is modeled by the contact elements CONTACT173 and TARGET170 placed along the separation surfaces as discussed in the next section. The model with the elasto-plastic constitutive law, the separation procedure, and with elastic incisions (see Fig. 1) requires a relatively large number of equilibrium iterations for convergence, therefore the calculations are generally long (typically lasting several hours). Therefore a number of meshing patterns (with high mesh density near the contact areas) were tried for balancing computational effort with accuracy of calculations. The effects of the element sizes on accuracy and convergence are discussed in the section presenting the results. In general only the models that can be considered converged are shown in this study.

The so-called wide blades (with width about 10 times greater than the cutting depth) can be represented by 2-D models that obviously are much more numerically efficient and easier to interpret. In such models SOLID45 was replaced by the quadrilateral PLANE42 elements with the plane strain option, and for contact the CONTACT171 and TARGET169 elements were used. For wide blades the 2D models produced similar results as the corresponding 3D model, but at a fraction of the computational effort.

Geometry of the 3D model is sketched in 
                           Fig. 2. The model is parametric with several parameters defining the geometry of soil and tool. The soil block is L
                           
                              s
                           =300mm long, w
                           
                              s
                           =300mm wide, and d
                           
                              o
                           =150mm deep. These dimensions were selected in such a way that the solution in the vicinity of the blade is not sensitive to the block׳s size. The block is divided into sub-blocks that can be meshed with different mesh densities. The maximum distance blade can travel while cutting the soil, also the length of contacts between upper and lower blocks of soil, is L
                           
                              f
                           =50mm (this dimension will be justified later). Parameter w
                           1 is the width of cut soil (also the width of blade), w
                           2 is the side width of soil block (and

                           , which is also the cutting depth of blade. Tilting of the blade with respect to the soil is defined by α, the rake angle.

The starting point of blade׳s travel inside the soil block is denoted by L

A typical meshing pattern is indicated in

The blade is fixed in Y and Z directions in order to limit blade motion in the X direction.

The meshing shown in Fig. 3 (which can be considered typical) uses a total number of 3548 hexagonal elements and 392 contact elements. For comparison the corresponding 2D model uses 408 quadrilateral elements and 36 contact elements

The soil is in contact with the blade on four surfaces shown in 
                           Fig. 4. The soil separation takes place along surfaces 1 and 3 (the vertical cuts) and along surface 2 (the horizontal cut). These surfaces will be referred to as the separation surfaces, and the contact elements with bonding and sliding options are used to model these connections. On surface 4, however, the soil should be allowed to slide along the blade without separation. Therefore the contact elements with only sliding option should be used there. This surface will be referred to as the sliding surface.

It should be noted that the separation surfaces are parallel to the direction of the blade׳s motion, while the sliding surface is parallel to the front of blade. For the numerical purposes the separation and sliding surfaces are actually modeled by two surfaces connected via the contact elements (and initially the nodes belonging to these two surfaces coincide). Such a configuration is indicated in 
                           Fig. 5 (this picture is not to scale and only the line representing the horizontal separation surface is shown). Any relative soil motion takes place on these surfaces during the soil–blade interaction.

The separation process is similar to the process of cutting chips in machining operations [20–22] or to the crack propagation process, i.e., there is always a small crack moving in front of the blade that allows the blade to travel through the soil (such a crack can be observed on the deformation pattern shown in Fig. 8). The nodes on the separation surface can move apart if a specified separation criterion is met. The distance u traveled by the blade׳s tip is measured from

                           , and its maximum value is

                           .

The elements above and below the expected separation surface are connected at nodes using the contact elements that allow to activate or deactivate the bonding forces between them. The highest stress/deformation level is observed always in the element which is at the tip of the opening and is of a particular interest during the whole simulation. At the beginning all bonding forces are active and this element (to be referred to as the tip element) is adjacent to the tip of blade. As the blade starts to move, stresses go through the elastic phase (see the broken line in Fig. 1) until the solid line representing the yielding condition (1) is reached (where the Drucker–Prager plasticity rules are followed). In the tip element the strain component

                            (in the direction of the blade׳s motion) is monitored continuously. The elasto-plastic process will continue until

At this instant the force bonding the nodes at the opening׳s tip (of the tip element) is deactivated, and the node separate generating the first opening of length equal to the size of the element׳s side. This is also associated with the stresses being relieved to the state denoted by point

                            is dependent on internal friction angle. By increasing internal friction angle the value of limiting strain increases almost linearly.

Since the continuous process of cutting the soil is modeled ‘discretely’ (by disjoining consecutive nodes on the separation surface), the local stiffness in the vicinity of the opening׳s tip changes abruptly with the system appearing to be slightly stiffer before the separation and slightly softer after separation. Such effects will be taken into account in the next section that presents the method of calculating the draft force required to move the blade through soil.

The separation procedure also affects how the stress state in soil follows the Drucker–Prager criterion (1), which in the

                            (just before the first separation). Then for the next point to separate the history starts at

                            (just before the second separation, and so on).

It should be noted that the curves for the states

                            are in general relatively close to each other (especially in the scale shown in Fig. 6b), and are getting closer with consecutive separations. Such curves essentially coincide after about five separations indicating that the simulation of the cutting process stabilizes, i.e., it becomes independent of the preliminary phase that starts from the unloaded state (this will be used in calculating the draft force from the plots as discussed in 
                           Fig. 7).

From the numerical point of view, the simulation with such stress histories demands larger number of equilibrium iterations (we used the standard updated Newton–Raphson method) and a very careful monitoring of the convergence at each load step.

As already mentioned the analysis is quasi-static, the stress–strain states in the whole FE model are calculated for increasing horizontal distance traveled by the blade (denoted by u in Fig. 5). The forces (draft and lift) acting on the blade are determined by properly integrating the stress components. The increments of u are assumed in steps (representing as the ‘load’ steps in ANSYS), which are larger between the separation instances and smaller around the separation. The size of each subsequent step can be estimated from the

                            readings of the previous step. The values of such steps are quite important from the numerical viewpoint since too small steps may result in a substantial increase of the time of calculations.

For an assumed mesh size a typical calculated draft force depends on the distance traveled as shown in Fig. 7. The calculations start as elastic (OE range) with all the bonding forces active (and therefore all the soil elements still connected), enter the plastic deformation at some point E, and then go to inelastic phase until deformation in the vicinity of the tip of the blade (point A) measured as

                           . This happens when the blade׳s displacement and the corresponding draft force reach the level defined as point

                           .

Then the bonding force in the first node is deactivated (or the elements above and below the separation plane closest to the blade are allowed to separate) that brings about a drop in the magnitude of the draft force to the value corresponding to point

The opening equal to the element size along the separation surface is created and the stresses and deformation in its vicinity are reduced enough (see the explanations in the previous section) for the analysis to start at

                           , which takes place at the blade׳s displacement and the draft force denoted by point

                           . Deactivating the bonding force in the second node bring the draft force to the level indicated by point

                           Fig. 7 represents a typical relationship for the draft force versus the blade׳s displacement covering five separations (i.e., the cutting/opening runs through five elements) as obtained from the simulation.

Some details of the meshing and opening after three separations are shown in 
                           Fig. 8. One can note in the enlarged picture that the elements above the separation line have shrunk about 30% in the horizontal direction, which is the consequence of assuming ε

The separation simulated by the FE model takes place sequentially at the nodes on the separation surfaces, as already discussed. When the bonding force at a particular node is deactivated the system suddenly changes its overall stiffness resulting in the draft force drop indicated by a jump

                           . It should be noted that in the ‘discrete’ modeling the separation force

                            is calculated for an underestimated length of the opening in front of the blade (i.e., shorter than for continues separation), and for an overestimated bonding force in the node to separate. Similarly, force

                              (

                            is calculated for an overestimated length of the opening and for an underestimated bonding force at the same node. Therefore one may interpret

Therefore it can be considered as an approximation of the draft force for the blade׳s displacement u at the instant of a particular separation. This force is plotted as a broken line,

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS@&#

In this section the FE model and procedure proposed are tested for convergence. The main focus is on accuracy of calculating the draft force. The results are validated by comparing them with the formulas that for straight blades are available in the literature.

As discussed in Section 2.2.4 the choice of the size of elements on the separation surface in the vicinity of the blade׳s tip, denoted by e in Fig. 8, affects the plot representing the calculated draft force and the displacement of the blade. Typical results for different e and for d

                        , but also makes the mesh more dense that in turn increases the computation time.

For example, if e=8.7mm (low density meshing, 1876 elements) then the calculation time to obtain the F–u plot for u up to 16mm is about 15h (for a computer with Intel core i5 3.2GH processor and 4GB of RAM). If the element size is reduced to e=7.8mm (for regular density meshing, 2472 elements) then the time increases to 19h, and to 22h if e=6.7
                        mm (for high density meshing, 2854 elements).

The simulations rendered the deformation patterns that generally agreed with the expectations and what was described in [28,29]. For the case in Figs. 9 and 10 the displacement in the z-direction when the blade is moved by about u=16mm is presented in 
                        Fig. 13. The disturbed soil is accumulated in front of the blade and tends to swell up in upward and lateral directions with respect to its original configuration. Also, the profile of accumulated soil form a convex curve as indicated in [29]. It can be seen more clearly in 
                        Fig. 14.

The plastic strains in the X–Y plane of the blade׳s front for u=16mm are plotted in Fig. 14. One can observe that these strains concentrate in a relatively narrow band inclined about 
                           θ
                           ≈

                         from the horizontal line. According to the simplified limit analysis this inclination should be

                         which is close to the value obtained from the simulation in FEA.

Similar deformation patterns were obtained for the case from Figs. 11 and 12. 
                        Fig. 15 shows the deformed shape after the blade has been moved by about u=8mm with the soil accumulation and the upper surface profile analogous to the previous case. A more detailed horizontal displacement distribution in the X–Y plane is plotted in 
                        Fig. 16.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

A new procedure for simulating the soil–blade interaction by the Finite Element Method is presented. The procedure combines the non-associated Drucker–Prager constitutive law with a compaction strain based separation criterion to describe the behavior of soil while being cut by the blade. Several separation and sliding surfaces are defined and utilized in the analysis. The elements on these surfaces are bonded to each other by special use of contact elements. During motion of the blade through soil, the bonding along the separation surfaces is allowed to break resulting in separation of the soil elements in front of the blade. The sliding surfaces allow the soil to slide upward and sideways of the blade. A method of calculating the draft force that essentially eliminates the effects of ‘discrete’ disjoining particular nodes is proposed and tested for convergence.

The whole procedure is applied here to simulate the straight blades only, mainly for the purpose of validation. The simulation results appear to show a good correlation when compared with the semi-analytical formulas of the classical soil mechanics.

It is planned to extend the procedure׳s applications to the analysis of blades of arbitrary shapes, which in turn can be used in developing software for optimization of the tillage operations.
