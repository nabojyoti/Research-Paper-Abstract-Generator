                  Condensation technique of degree of freedom is firstly proposed to improve the computational efficiency of meshfree method with Galerkin weak form. In present method, scattered nodes without connectivity are divided into several subsets by cells with arbitrary shape. The local discrete equations are established over each cell by using moving kriging interpolation, in which the nodes that located in the cell are used for approximation. Then, the condensation technique can be introduced into the local discrete equations by transferring equations of inner nodes to equations of boundary nodes based on cell. In the scheme of present method, the calculation of each cell is carried out by meshfree method with Galerkin weak form, and local search is implemented in interpolation. Numerical examples show that the present method has high computational efficiency and convergence, and good accuracy is also obtained.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the recent two decades, the development and application of meshfree methods have attracted much attention. One of the reasons is the versatility of meshfree methods for complex geometry of solids and flexibility for different engineering problems [1]. Element free Galerkin (EFG) method, which is originated by Belytschko et al. [2–5], is one of the most widely used meshfree methods. The key advantage of EFG method is that only nodal data is required and no element connectivity is needed, when moving least squares (MLS) interpolation is used to construct trial and test functions. However, because shape functions constructed by MLS interpolation do not possess Kronecker delta function property, the treatment of essential boundary conditions is one of the typical drawbacks. Thus, many special techniques have been proposed to impose essential boundary conditions [6–8], such as point collocation [6], Lagrange multipliers [2], singular weighting functions [7] and penalty method [8]. None of these methods is fully satisfactory, as they still need additional efforts to enforce essential boundary conditions.

In order to totally eliminate the drawback associated with EFG method for imposing essential boundary conditions, Liu and Gu have developed the Point Interpolation Methods (PIM) by using polynomial basis or/and radial basis function (RBF) [9–12]. Gu has firstly introduced the moving kriging (MK) interpolation-based meshfree method for solving a simple steady-state heat conduction problem [13]. Through PIM and MK interpolation, the shape functions with the delta function property can be obtained, and then the essential boundary conditions can be imposed easily. A comparison between the radial point interpolation method (RPIM) and the kriging interpolations is presented by Dai et al. for elasticity [14]. Moreover, Lam et al. has introduced a local kriging (LoKriging) method into two-dimensional (2D) solid mechanics problems [15], and Li et al. has further developed the LoKriging method for structural dynamics analysis [16]. Furthermore, a moving kriging interpolation-based element free Galerkin method is developed by Bui et al. for static analysis, structural dynamic analysis and free vibration analysis of Kirchhoff plates [17–19].

On the other hand, high computational cost is still one of main drawbacks in meshfree method with Galerkin weak form. The global search is implemented in approximation functions of displacement, even though the PIM or MK interpolation is used in the discrete formulations based on global or local Galerkin weak form. One of the reasons is the low efficiency of global search. In this paper, a local search technique is proposed based on cell, and condensation technique is used to improve computational efficiency of meshfree method with Galerkin weak form. Condensation technique is used to reduce the degree of freedom by transferring displacements of inner nodes to displacements of boundary nodes in system equations, which is usually used in finite element method (FEM) [20–22].

The outline of this paper is as following. The discrete domain with distributed nodes and cells are described in Section 2. In Section 3, a brief summary of MK interpolation is given. In Section 4, we present the elastic static formulations of meshfree-based local Galerkin method, the condensation technique and the flowchart of present method. In Section 5, numerical examples are investigated and discussed. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 6.

The accuracy of meshfree methods depends on the number of nodes for interpolation. In the previous works by authors [2–5], the number of nodes for interpolation is determined by the influence domain with a specified radius. And the number of interpolated nodes may be changed with different interest point x. In this paper, the number of nodes for interpolation is not changed, and it is determined by the n nearest neighboring nodes of x in cell

In the meshfree-based local Galerkin method, compatibility of displacements must be satisfied at intersection line of adjacent cells for 2D problems. If criterion of compatibility is satisfied, compatibility will be obtained in present method. In addition, if criterion of completeness is also satisfied as compatibility is obtained, convergence will be assured. Criterions of compatibility and completeness are described as follows, which are proved in FEM.

In the equations of variational weak form, the highest order derivative of displacement function is m. Continuity, up to m−1 order derivative of displacement function, must be satisfied at the intersection line.

In the equations of variational weak form, the highest order derivative of displacement function is m. Complete polynomial of m order must be included in the approximation functions of displacement.

For 2D elasticity mechanics, the highest order derivative of displacement function in the weak form (18) is 1. In MK interpolation, adding complete polynomial of quadratic order can ensure reproduction of linear field. Then compatibility and completeness of present method will be satisfied. If continuity of higher derivatives are required in the problems of plate or shell, complete polynomial of higher order will ensures the compatibility and convergence of present method.

Flowchart of present meshfree-based local Galerkin method is given in 
                        Table 1.

Numerical examples of 2D problems are presented to analyze the performance of meshfree-based local Galerkin method without or with condensation of degree of freedom.

Patch test is a sufficient requirement as a means of assessing the convergence of a numerical method. In this paper, linear displacements 
                           u
                           (
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           )
                           =
                           x
                           /
                           y
                         are imposed along the boundaries of a patch with one interior node. Satisfaction of the patch test requires that the displacements of the interior node exactly follow the same function of the imposed displacements.

Moreover, in order to assess the accuracy of present method influenced by the shape of cell, different shape are used for patch test, as show in 
                        Fig. 2, which include triangle with large obtuse angle, square, narrow rectangle and abnormal quadrangle. 
                        Table 2 lists the coordinates of nodes in the different shape of patch test. It is found that the meshfree-based local Galerkin method can pass all the patch test within machine precision regardless of the shape of patch. It means that the arbitrary shape can be chosen as the cell in present method.

                        Fig. 4 shows the discrete domain of cantilever beam, in which 8 regular cells and 33×9 uniformly distributed nodes are used. In order to study on accuracy of results influenced by the number of nodes n for interpolation based on cell, 
                        Fig. 5 shows relative error of Sobolev norm of displacement obtained by meshfree-based local Galerkin method, when n=12, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, and 27. It is noted that the number of nodes n for interpolation is slightly sensitive to the solutions of present method. And the large or small n will decrease the accuracy of results, the best results are obtained as n=20 in this case. The sensitivity of interpolation influenced by the number of nodes n also occurs in the MLS approximation of EFG method [2].

For analysis of computational accuracy and efficiency influenced by the number of cells M,

                         uniformly distributed nodes are used in the entire problem domain. And 1, 2, 4 and 8 regular cells are used in problem domain, as shown in 
                        Fig. 6(a). Fig. 6(b) shows boundary nodes of cells in the cantilever beam. Displacements

                         obtained by present method without and with condensation of degree of freedom are shown in 
                        Fig. 7, when different number of cells M is used. It can be seen that the numerical results with different number of cells are in good agreement with analytical results. Condensation technique of present method does not affect on the accuracy of results.

In order to analyze the accuracy of results as the total number of nodes in a cell is equal to the number of nodes n for interpolation, which is the minimum number of nodes in the cell. 17×5 uniformly distributed nodes and 8 cells with the same shape of rectangle are used in the entire problem domain of cantilever beam. The number of nodes for interpolation and the number of nodes in cell are 15 simultaneously. Displacements

                           2
                         obtained by present method and analytical method are plotted in 
                        Fig. 8. Good accuracy of results is also obtained in this case, which validate the stability of present method based on cells.

For convergence analysis of meshfree-based local Galerkin method, 1, 2, 4 and 8 regular cells corresponding to 21, 39, 65 and 119 uniformly distributed nodes are used in entire problem domain, separately. Then 21 nodes are distributed in each cell. 
                        Fig. 9 shows relative error of Sobolev norm of displacement and energy. It can be seen that high convergence are obtained in present method without and with condensation of degree of freedom.


                        
                        Table 3 shows relative computational cost of present method with 1, 2, 4 and 8 cells, as shown in Fig. 6. Relative computational cost is defined as the ratio of time spending of meshfree-based local Galerkin method with M cells to time spending of the method proposed in [13], which is the same with the present method with 1 cell. Table 3 shows that more number of cells in problem domain, higher computational efficiency of present method is obtained, which is realized by improving local search efficiency with reducing the number of nodes in each cell. Furthermore, in order to study the performance of present method for solving large scale problems, 2425 uniformly distributed nodes with 1, 2, 4 and 8 regularly distributed cells are used to enlarge the size of stiffness matrix, separately. 
                        Table 4 shows that the computational efficiency of present method with 8 cells is improved for nearly 41 times compared with that of 1 cell. Tables 3 and 4 also show that the larger scale of problems, the higher computational efficiency of present method will be obtained compared with the method proposed in [13]. And the computational cost of present method with condensation is less than that without condensation. Moreover, the consuming of computer memory can be reduced by condensation of degree of freedom in the calculation of system equations.


                        
                        Fig. 10 shows CPU time of EFG method [2], RPIM method [24], method of Ref. [13] and present method with condensation, in which the CPU time is in seconds. In this case, 
                           33
                           ×
                           9
                         uniformly distributed nodes are used for calculation in different methods, and 8 regular cells are used in present method. It can be seen that the present method consumes less CPU time than EFG method, RPIM method and Gu's method proposed in [13].

Meshfree-based local Galerkin method apply to the stress analysis of a dam subjected to hydrostatic pressure on both sides of the dam, as shown in 
                        Fig. 11. The problems is solved for the plane strain case with E=30Gpa and v=0.15. In the dam, 8 cells with 521 nodes are irregularly distributed in the model, as shown in 
                        Fig. 12. Numerical results of present method are compared with solutions of ANSYS software, in which the model of ANSYS is established by using quadrilateral elements.

The displacements 
                           
                              
                                 u
                              
                              
                                 x
                              
                           
                         at x=0 are plotted in 
                        Fig. 13. The results obtained by present method with irregularly distributed cells and nodes are in good agreement with those obtained by ANSYS software. The distribution of stress in the dam obtained by present method without and with condensation of degree of freedom is plotted in 
                        Fig. 14, respectively. It can be seen that the good accuracy of stress is also obtained compare with the results of ANSYS software. The condensation technique of present method does not affect on accuracy of stress distribution. 
                        Fig. 15 shows CPU time of different methods. It can also be seen that present method can improve computational efficiency greatly.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, a local variational weak formulation is established based on cells, and the local discrete equations are obtained by using MK interpolation. The main merit of present method is that computational efficiency is improved by following issues:
                        
                           (1)
                           The whole domain of problem is divided into cells and the quadrature points inside a cell are influenced only by the nodes in the same cell. Thus, considerable CPU time can be saved since the neighbor searching can be localized to each cell instead of the whole domain.

Static condensation technique is applied to reduce the degree of freedom of problems in present method, which is implemented by transferring equations of inner nodes to equations of boundary nodes based on cells.

Finally, Numerical examples also show that the present method have good computational accuracy, high efficiency and convergence. The proposed meshfree-based local Galerkin method takes considerable step forward to transform mesh-free formulation into more competitive techniques.
