                  To analyze thin bending plates, a triangular and a quadrilateral element are presented in this paper. These suggested elements are formulated based on the hybrid-Trefftz method. The triangular element is named as THT-15, and it has 6 nodes and 18 degrees of freedom. The quadrilateral element is composed of 8 nodes and 24 degrees of freedom, and it is denoted as QHT-23. Two independent fields are introduced: one within the element and the other on the edges of the element. The internal field satisfies the governing equation of the thin plates. The boundary field is related to the nodal degrees of freedom by shape functions. For better capability, the shape functions of a 3 node Euler–Bernoulli beam are used for each edge of the element. The order of these functions for the deflection, rotation and torsion fields is equal to five, four and two, respectively. By depicting these fields in general coordinates, x–y, shape functions for the elements׳ edges are obtained. Several numerical tests are performed to assess the robustness of the suggested elements. The findings demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed elements in analyzing the thin bending plates.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Thin plate bending is widely utilized in the fields of aerospace, mechanics and civil engineering. These kinds of plates are formulated based on Kirchhoff׳s theory. In this theory, the shear deformation of the element is not considered [1]. The finite element method has been extensively used to analyze thin bending plates. Consequently, various elements have been presented. Some of these elements are formulated by employing Ritz׳s strategy. In this approach, the element׳s degree of freedom and the field function׳s order are enlarged to increase the efficiency of the finite element scheme [2–8]. It is worth emphasizing that the accuracy of this method is not high. In general, continuity does not exist in inter-elements when the aforementioned tactic is deployed. Hybrid functionals are used to formulate some other types of finite elements. In these techniques, the number of master fields is more than one.

By introducing independent fields in the interfaces, a hybrid functional can be established. This functional is utilized to create finite elements with high efficiency. Several independent fields are deployed by the hybrid functional. It is worth emphasizing that this functional employs independent boundary displacement fields. Fortunately, the continuity condition is not required to be established in the element׳s boundaries [9]. Pian formulated the first hybrid element for plane stress problems [10]. Prior to using this method in analyzing bending plates, it was employed in solving plane problems. By employing the hybrid functional, extensive research has been performed in the area of solving the bending plates, so far [11–13].

The ability of the hybrid formulation in constructing efficient elements resulted in development of hybrid Trefftz (HT) methods. It should be added that independent displacement fields are applied in this technique. To solve various problems in solid mechanics, both Ritz and hybrid-Trefftz techniques can be used. In contrast to Ritz׳s algorithm, the problems׳ governing differential equations are set up by a field function when the hybrid-Trefftz approach is employed. In other words, both homogenous and particular solutions of the governing equations are deployed to formulate the finite element. By using independent boundary displacement field and variational principles, weak forms of the compatibility between elements are obtained in the hybrid-Trefftz method. Note that integration on the boundary of the elements is permissible in this approach. The mentioned characteristic is considered as the main advantage of this technique. Clearly, integration on the boundary is much easier than integration on the surface. In addition, polygon elements can be produced when integration on the boundary is possible. To express the superiority of this approach over the conventional ones, some of its advantages are mentioned below [14]:
                        
                           (1)
                           Continuity exists in the hybrid tactic, and it is not necessary to set up continuity as an additional condition.

Without employing a new complex formulation, it is possible to define numerous degrees of freedom on the boundary of the element.

The element has high accuracy because of appropriate polynomials, which satisfy the governing equation.

The Hybrid-Trefftz formulation was first employed to assess the distorted meshes of the thin plates by Jirousek and Leon in 1970s [15]. This technique soon attracted the attention of other researchers due to its high accuracy and efficiency. The aforementioned approach has been deployed successfully to solve planar problems, thin plates, thick plates, shells and three-dimensional problems [16]. For analysis of thin bending plates, various triangular and quadrilateral elements have been formulated by Jirousek [15–18]. In the aforesaid elements, the p-version tactic has been used. By defining virtual nodes in the middle of the element׳s sides, a boundary displacement field was obtained for the formulation. This procedure was slightly complicated. Rezaiee-Pajand et al. proposed efficient triangular and quadrilateral elements for analysis of the thin plates. In the study, they utilized the interpolation functions of the Euler–Bernoulli Beam with two nodes [19]. In addition, Rezaiee-Pajand and Karkon employed interpolation functions of Timoshenko׳s beam for boundary fields to solve Reissner–Mindlin plates [20]. To analyze these plates, Petrolito presented a quadrilateral element composed of four nodes and a triangular element with three nodes. He used quadratic boundary displacement and linear boundary rotation field [21,22]. Note that higher-order elements, such as quadrilateral elements with eight nodes and triangular elements with six nodes, have high accuracy in coarse meshes. Due to this characteristic, they have received considerable attention. However, these elements have not been employed in the hybrid-Trefftz methods. It should be added that these elements are extensively deployed in other approaches [23–26].

In this paper, by employing the hybrid-Trefftz functional, higher-order triangular and quadrilateral elements are presented to analyze the thin bending plates; these elements are composed of six and eight nodes, respectively. The homogenous and particular solutions of the governing equations are deployed to establish the inner displacement field of the elements. It is worth emphasizing that the inner displacement fields are the same in all the elements, which are used for analysis of the thin bending plates. Moreover, boundary interpolation functions relate nodal degrees of freedom to the independent boundary displacement field. In this formulation, the shape functions, of a 3 node Euler–Bernoulli beam, are utilized. The orders of the shape functions for the deflection, rotation and torsion fields are equal to five, four and two, respectively. By depicting the aforesaid fields in general coordinates, x–y, the shape functions of the presented elements׳ edges are obtained. Finally, several numerical tests are performed to investigate the robustness of these elements. The findings prove that the suggested elements are able to calculate the stresses and strains with high level of accuracy. Furthermore, it will be clearly demonstrated that the authors׳ elements are insensitive to mesh distortion.

                     In the hybrid-Trefftz formulation, the internal displacement is selected such that it satisfies the governing equation. Therefore, the first term on the right-hand side of Eq. (6) is equal to zero. As a result, the previous relationship will change to the next shape:

In the particular and homogeneous solutions, there is no advantage over x and y; therefore, the element will be rotational invariant. The minimum of the terms selected from the homogenous solution is dependent on the element׳s number of degrees of freedom. The number of necessary terms (and not sufficient) to preclude numerical instability and deficiency the rank of the stiffness matrix is acquired by employing the following relation [16,18]:

                      and r denote the number of the element׳s degrees of freedom and rigid body motions, respectively. It should be mentioned that using modes of the rigid body motion produces spurious strain energy in the element. Consequently, these modes should be omitted. The number of modes of rigid body motions in the plate is three, namely a transitive mode and two rotational modes in the direction of x-axis and y-axis. As a result, Eq. (33) can be rewritten for the plates as given below:

                     In general, the minimum number of homogenous solutions, which satisfies the condition of Eq. (34), provides a high level of accuracy for the element [19,20,27]. Therefore, the proposed elements THT-15 with 15 functions and QHT-23 with 23 Trefftz functions are the most accurate elements.

Based on the particular and homogenous solutions of differential Eq. (21), the inner displacement field can be stated as having the following shape:

                     The element׳s stiffness matrix and nodal forces can be easily obtained by inserting these relations in Eqs. (19) and (20).

The independent boundary displacement is related to the nodal values by interpolation functions. For this purpose, the interpolation functions of the three node Euler–Bernoulli beam which is shown in Fig. (2-1) will be utilized for the boundary of the elements. Then, the aforesaid element׳s interpolation functions are obtained. At first, the beam demonstrated in Fig. (2-2) is deployed. Each node of this element has three degrees of freedom (

                      is a quadratic function. To achieve the interpolation functions of the element׳s sides, firstly, the displacement, rotation and torsion fields should be calculated. Then, the obtained functions should be depicted in general coordinates. The relationship between the displacement field and the rotation field of the beam, shown in Fig. (2-2), is as follows:

The concentrated loads and mesh geometry of this test are shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, boundary conditions of this test are w=0 at nodes 1, 2, and 4. The exact moments, M

The mesh from Fig. 3 is used for the constant curvature case, as well. The test is performed by enforcing transverse displacement and rotations on the boundary of the patch as follows:

In this section, a square plate is analyzed under two load cases: a uniform distributed load and a concentrated load applied to the center of the plate. The findings including the central deflection and moments of the plates are listed in the following tables. 
                        
                        Tables 2 and 3 demonstrate the central deflection and moment, respectively, of the simply supported square plate. The obtained results of the analysis of the square plate with clamped supports are shown in 
                        
                        Tables 4 and 5. In addition, the square plate is analyzed under concentrated load with simple and clamped supports. Then, the central deflections are listed in 
                        
                        Tables 6 and 7. The proposed element׳s convergence plot versus the degrees of freedom is presented to prove that these elements are more efficient than other ones (
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Figs. 4–8). These plots demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the authors׳ elements, in comparison to other researchers׳ elements.

In order to assess the sensitivity of the proposed elements to mesh distortion, two numerical tests are performed. Firstly, a square plate with simple supports is analyzed under a uniform distributed load. Then, the central deflection and moment of a square plate with clamped supports are obtained. In this case, the plate is subjected to a distributed load. To carry out these tests, the distorted mesh shown in 
                        Fig. 9 is employed for a quarter of the plate. The amount of the mesh׳s distortion parameter is denoted by α. It is worth emphasizing that the selection of 
                           α
                           =
                           0.25
                         leads to regular meshing. Note that other values of this parameter result in distortion. The normalized values of the central deflection and moment of the plate, which is simply supported, are listed in 
                        Table 8. In addition, 
                        Table 9 demonstrates the normalized values of the central deflection and moment of the plate with clamped supports. According to the findings, it is obvious that these elements are insensitive to distortion. It should be mentioned that the results have high level of accuracy even in the case where poor meshing (
                           α
                           =
                           0.01
                        ) is deployed.

                        It should be mentioned that the analytical solution for a simply supported square plate under this load case is identical to the particular solution [28]. The central deflection and moment of the square plate (b=a), for simple and clamped supports, are given in 
                        
                        Tables 10 and 11, respectively. The meshes have been used for a whole plate. These tables reveal that the proposed elements have high accuracy and a rapid rate of convergence to the exact solutions. It should be added that for the clamped support case, the analytical solution is not available.

                        To perform this test, a square plate with three different boundary conditions is analyzed and central deflection and moments are obtained. The meshes have been used for the whole plate. The results for simple and clamped supports are shown in 
                        
                        Tables 12 and 13, respectively. Furthermore, the results of the square plate with two opposite edges simply supported and the other two edges clamped (AD and BC are simply, AB and CD are clamped) are listed in 
                        Table 14. The exact solution for this case of the boundary condition is available as [48]

In this section, an annular plate that is clamped on the outer boundary and is subjected to a uniform load is considered. Due to its symmetry, only a quarter of this plate is analyzed. 
                        Fig. 12 shows this plate and its mesh (N=2). Because of the curvature, some errors appear. In this problem, due to the curved geometry and shape of this plate, the geometric error is significant. In general, high-order elements over-constrain the problem on the interpolated clamped boundary more than lower order elements [21]. The maximum displacements and moments of this plate are listed in 
                        Table 15. The findings demonstrate the great efficiency of the proposed elements in analyzing this plate. Also, it can be proved that the triangular element, shown by THT-15, is more accurate in comparison to the quadrilateral one, named QHT-23.

Razzaque’s skew plate is shown in 
                        Fig. 13. The sides of this plate are simple on two opposite edges and free on the other two edges. By utilizing the finite difference method, Razzaque has analyzed this plate under a uniform distribute load q=1. Note that he employed a 16×16 mesh. The central deflection and the moment are as given below [49]:

                        This structure has been analyzed with different meshes. The obtained results are shown in 
                        
                        Tables 16 and 17. In addition, in order to make a comparison, the results of other researchers׳ elements are listed in these tables. Based on these tables, it can be deduced that the suggested elements are much more accurate than other elements. 
                        Fig. 14 shows error percentages for deflection at the center of Razzaque׳s plate for different elements. It is evident that the suggested elements have high accuracy in solving this severe problem.

The analysis of Morley׳s skew plate is considered to be of the most difficult problems [50]. This structure is a simply supported rhombic plate with a skew angle of α=30°. Due to the existence of the acute angle, the deflection of the plate varies rapidly. On the other hand, the rate of convergence to the exact solution is slow. This plate is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 15.

It should be added that the Poisson׳s ratio of this plate is 0.3 and a distribute load q is applied to this plate. In order to impose conditions related to the supports, a soft support and a hard one are deployed. The edges which are parallel to the x-axis have a hard simple support. In other words, deflection and rotation with respect to y-axis are assumed to be zero. Only deflection is prevented in the other edges. The authors׳ elements are utilized to analyze this plate. Besides, the results obtained by other researchers are provided. 
                        Table 18 includes the central deflection of the plate obtained using various meshes. Moreover, the maximum and minimum values of the central moment are tabulated in 
                        
                        Tables 19 and 20, respectively. The results demonstrate the high accuracy of the suggested elements.

At this stage, the strain energy of the Morley plate is calculated using the proposed elements. The obtained results are compared with other researchers׳ results. Babuska and Scapolla have solved this problem as a 3D elastic structure. Their responses are considered as referenced values (

                        Fig. 16 shows the skew cantilever plate. The analyses of this plate are performed for uniformly distributed loading and for three skew angles, namely β=20°, 40° and 60°. The importance of this study is due to torsion in the plate, as none of the elements proposed by other researchers converge into an analytical solution [52]. The results are demonstrated in

The new elements are formulated based on the hybrid-Trefftz method. Both displacement fields on the borders and within the element are assumed to be independent. For the latter field, homogenous and particular solutions of the differential equations are employed. The boundary field is related to the nodal degrees of freedom by shape functions. For better capability, the shape functions of a 3 node Euler–Bernoulli beam are used for each edge of the element. To investigate the capability of the proposed elements, several numerical tests have been performed. The findings prove the rapid convergence of the authors׳ elements. It should be added that the QHT-23 element is more accurate than the triangular one. Moreover, this element can converge more rapidly, in comparison to the THT-15 element. In conclusion, the solution accuracies of the famous benchmark problems provide the justification of the suggested elements.
