                  A mixed 8-nodes quadrilateral 16 dof membrane finite element, called HQ8-13β, is proposed. It is developed within the Hellinger–Reissner variational framework: the assumed stress is self-equilibrated and based on Airy stress solution and the kinematics includes drilling rotations handled à la Allman. It is particularly suitable for recovering constant bending solution accurately with less sensitivity to mesh distortion. On the whole, it shows accuracy also for very coarse meshes anda convergence of order

                     . Its performance has been extensively investigated. Patch tests, considering constant stress, constant and linear bending, are passed. Convergence and the accuracy, in higher order benchmarks, compare well with other elements available in the literature, stress recovery being less sensitive to the mesh distortion. The handling of drilling rotations, which avoids spurious modes without introducing penalty constraints, allows the rotations field to be accurately recovered, making the element suitable for the geometrically nonlinear analysis within a corotational formulation.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Research in developing high performance membrane finite elements, accurate for coarse meshes and less sensitive to geometry distortion, is even nowparticularly active [1–9]. Often, membrane elements are coupled with bending discretization to be used in linear and geometrically nonlinear analysis of folded plates, box structures also assembled with other type of element, as was given in [10,11]. For this purpose, the use of drilling rotations as nodal variables is an essential feature [12–16].

The mixed 4-node membrane element HQ4-9β described in [2] is a simple, accurate element which accounts for drilling rotations and avoids spurious zero-energy modes without needing penalty constraint or unsymmetrical formulations [17]. Its behavior in linear context is very good and noticeably improvesupon the classic Allman element AQD4 [18,19]. Patch tests in the recovery of constant stress modes [20] are passed with insensitivity to mesh distortion and those regarding constant membranal bending are passed for regular mesh, exactly, and show a quite good accuracy in distorted geometry. When high order modes and more general test cases are considered, HQ4-9β always shows a good rate of convergence and satisfactory accuracy. In particular, it accurately recovers the rotation field and does not exhibit spurious energy modes. Therefore, it is suitable for geometrically nonlinear analysis into the framework of a corotational description [10,11,21–23].

Our current purpose is toset up a new finite element to further improve 
                        HQ

                      and obtain a good recovery also in case of rough distorted meshes. To obtain accurate or, at least, robust solution in cases of complex or distorted geometries without using an excessive number of elements is obviously a great advantage in technical applications while distortion sensitivity is a potential drawback in quadrangular elements, especially in recovering bending solution. The performance of parametric elements in distorted geometry has been recently investigated in [24]. The problem can be related to the use of the internal dimensionless coordinates in defining both displacements and stress interpolations. The element proposed in [25], based on area coordinates, reduces the sensitivity to mesh distortion but implies the violation of compatibility as shown in [26]. Further attempts to cure sensibility to mesh distortion have been made by Rajendran using unsymmetric formulation [27,28] and by Panasz et al. using corrected shape functions [29].

The present proposal, an 8-node quadrilateral with 16 dof, called HQ8-13β, can be considered a quite natural evolution of HQ4-9β. Once again, the element is based on a mixed description within the Hellinger–Reissner variational formulation, which offers the possibility toset up high performance finite elements [30]. The related literature is very rich and many finite elements have also been developed recently. Briefly we recall the membrane part of the shell element, called HBQ8, proposed by Darilmaz and Kumbasar [31] and the 8-node element called Flex8 proposed in [32]. In the former, the membrane kinematics is controlled by three dofs per node (two displacements and one drilling rotation) and then by 24 dofs in total. Cubic shape functions are used for displacement interpolation while the stress is described by a 23-β stress parameterspolynomial expansion in Cartesian coordinates. In the latter, the kinematics is controlled by 16 dofs (two displacements per node) and by 14-β stress parameters (so it presents one extra hyperstatic degree).

The kinematics of HQ8-13β is obtained enhancing HQ4-9β by four additional parameters introducing the tangential displacements at middle point of each side to control a quadratic interpolation of the displacement along the side. Three dofs (two displacements and one drilling rotation) are used for each vertex and only one dof (the tangential displacement) for each side, being the quadratic interpolation of the transversal displacement already controlled according to Allman by the vertex rotations [18,19].

Recently a discussion on how toset up optimal stress in a hybrid element has been given in [33]. Here, the assumed stress is based on Airy fundamental solutions. It is isostatic and ruled by 13 stress parameters. The advantages of using stress derived from Airy solutions have been recently investigated by Cen et al. in [3]. They proposed two membrane mixed elements with 8 and 12 node, respectively. Both elements are controlled by displacement parameters, without drilling rotations, and use a statically redundant description. The results are very accurate over different benchmarks. In a further paper [4], the same authors proposed the use of Airy based stress in the setup of a 4-node statically determined mixed quadrilateral element with Allman drilling rotations. The use of Airy functions in the interpolation of the stress field has also been proposed by A. Cannarozzi and M. Cannarozzi in [34] for deriving 4 and 8 node mixed elements. Both elements present 3 dofs per node (two displacement and one drilling rotation). In particular, the 8-node uses a compatible interpolation of the displacements based on a 5th order polynomial expansion on each side and presents different options for the stress interpolation (a 21-β and a 25-β interpolation). The assumed stress, in Cartesian coordinates, for our proposal is self-equilibrated point-wise in the element and satisfies internal kinematical compatibility. This allows a better accuracy and lesser distortion sensitivity (as shown in [3]) but also reflects computational advantages becauseallows both compatibility and equilibrium matrices very simply by exact contour integration.

The performance of HQ8-13β was extensively investigated through numerical benchmarks. The element shows satisfactory accuracy for very coarse meshes and overall rate of convergence h
                     2 for stress and displacements. Different contexts were considered including problems with stress concentration and wall structures [35,36]. Several comparisons with other membrane elements available in the literature were also reported and discussed. A particular attention was also paid to checking for the absence of spurious energy modes and the accuracy in recovery drilling rotation.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the variational framework and the main equations used in deriving the element. Section 3 describes the proposed 8-nodes element and provides details for the evaluation of its relevant matrices. Section 4 considers a series of validation tests that highlight the performance of the element. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

Our proposal is framed within the mixed variational formulation and, more precisely, it is based on the well known Hellinger–Reissner condition:

Once the external actions have been assigned, we can analogously handle the external work W and represent it by the element force vector

                         is the standard assembly operator enforcing inter-element continuity of the displacement through direct identification of nodal variables. Note that, inter-element stress continuity conditions can not be assumed a priori (it will be recovered in the solution as a consequence of the variational conditions), so stress parameters in contiguous elements are independent from each other and then can be eliminated at the element level by static condensation. In this way, we obtain the usual pseudo-compatible format of (11)

                         collecting displacements and rotations of the four vertex nodes of the element and the tangential displacements of the middle sides. As already pointed out in the previous section, if assuming that stress interpolation satisfies bulk equilibrium with zero load as will be done in the following, the internal work can be obtained by integrating on the element contour through Eq. (5). So we only need to define the displacement interpolation along each side of the element. We express this interpolation as a sum of three contributions:

                         corresponds to an incompatible mode, orthogonal on average to constant stress and a linear one, introduced to avoid rank defectiveness of the element. The discontinuity at the inter-element boundaries introduced by this term is, however, irrelevant because it rapidly vanishes with mesh refinement (see [2] for further insight).

Stresses are defined in the Cartesian frame

                        So, the assumed stress interpolation corresponds to a combination of the Airy stress solutions, used in hierarchical polynomial order as proposed by Cen et al. [3,4]. Apart from other advantages, this choice will allow relevant element matrices to be evaluated more easily through line integration on the element contour as will be detailed in the following sections.

The element compliance matrix

                         is defined by Eq. (27).

Note that, the compliance and compatibility matrices (see Eqs. (33) and (35)) are evaluated by contour integration without the use of the local Jacobian

                         associated to dimensionless reference system 
                           {
                           ξ
                           ,
                           η
                           }
                         (see Eq. (15)). Actually, we only use the average Jacobian (see Eq. (16)) to define the rigid rotation of the element (Eqs. (17) and (18)) and then the local Cartesian system 
                           {
                           x
                           ,
                           y
                           }
                        . This also allows to handle elements with concave geometries.

The results from a numerical benchmarking will be discussed here to show the performance of the proposed element HQ8-13β in comparison with the elements available in the literature, including the assumed displacement shell element with reduced integration, called S8R, implemented in ABAQUS [38], the classical elements AQD4 and M-Type by Allman [19] and Ibrahimbegovic [39] respectively, the elements based on the hybrid Trefftz method by Choo and Choi [40,41], the assumed strain quadrilateral with drilling rotation by Pimpinelli [42] and the eight-node with drilling rotation by Zhang and Kuang [16], the recent membrane element by Rezaiee-Pajand and Karkon [8] based on analytical solution, the US-ATFQ8 element [5] based on the unsymmetrical trial function method, the eight node HSF-Q8-15β proposed by Cen et al. [3] and based on Airy stress functions and the HQB8 element proposed by Darilmaz et al. [31]. Stress recovering is represented by color maps. These always directly represent the numerical solution obtained, without using any a posteriori smoothing procedures. For the pre- and post-processing were used the GMSH mesh generator [43].

The comparisons of the different elements have been made using the same meshes and this does not correspond to the same number of nodal kinematical variables. Really, for fine meshes the eight node finite elements without drilling have 6/5 overall DOFs more than HQ8-13β. The ratio rises to 9/5 for those with drilling DOFs (see Table 1
                     ).

We start with the eigenvalues/eigenfrequencies analyses of a single element in order to check for the absence of spurious energy modes in both regular and distorted cases. Then we report some patch tests for constant and linear (in plane bending) stress fields. Constant stress is easily recovered. Constant bending stresses are very little affected by mesh distortion and show much better insensitivity than HQ4-9β. A test on a cantilever beam under shear force is also presented employing different meshes. The accuracy in the recovery drilling rotation field is shown by a cantilever beam in constant bending. Finally, the behavior of HQ8-13β in three different contexts is investigated. The first refers to the popular Cook׳s cantilever, the second to a square membrane with a circular hole, and the third to a wall structure with rectangular openings.

The first benchmarks refer to eigenvalues analyses of the stiffness matrix 
                           
                              
                                 K
                              
                              
                                 e
                              
                           
                         (see Eq. (12)) for single elements assuming E=1, ν=0.3 and t=1.0 and different shapes: a square of size 2×2, a rectangle of size 2×4, a parallelogram and a trapezium (see Fig. 2
                        ). The numerical results, reported in Table 2
                        , confirm that the element has no rank deficiency and that only three zero eigenvalues associated to the rigid displacements field are presented.

The further benchmark refers to the eigenfrequencies analysis for a single 1×1 square element, assuming a mass density ρ=1. The results, compared with the ones obtained with HQ4-9β element, are reported in Table 3
                         and are also displayed in Fig. 3
                        . They confirm, once again, the absence of spurious zero-energy modes. Four modes, corresponding to a shear and an hourglass mode and two expansion/contraction modes (mode 3, 4, 6 and 9) which coincide with the one provided by HQ4-9β. Differences are in wider reproduction of bending (mode 1, 2, 7, 8 11 and 12) and in the higher order modes (mode 5, 10 and 13). Note that differences are sensible also for modes seeming similar in shape (e.g. modes 1, 2, 5, 11, 12 of HQ8-13β and modes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 of HQ4-9β, see Fig. 3).

As widely discussed in [20], the constant patch tests must be passed to ensure convergence for a finite element formulation, while the higher order ones provide a criteria for performance evaluation. The HQ8-13β passes all constant patch tests exactly even for a highly distorted mesh, the constant solutions being contained in the space of the finite element interpolation. These rather trivial results are not reported here. We only note that, as for HQ4-9β, the use of an incompatible cubic mode plays an important role in this [2]. In fact, when using a cubic compatible function instead of an incompatible cubic mode the constant patch tests do not pass in distorted geometries.

                        Regular and distorted meshes have been considered (see Fig. 5
                        ). The results regarding stress and displacement values at relevant points in comparison with the exact and HQ4-9β solutions are listed in Tables 4 and 5
                        
                        . Fig. 6

                         stress map for the very distorted mesh 6 (see Fig. 5) compared with the one provided by HQ4-9β. It is clear from these figures that HQ8-13β is quite insensitive to mesh distortion for constant bending stresses recovery and noticeably improves the performances of HQ4-9β, which is one of the main goals of its setup.

The performance of HQ8-13β is compared here with HQ4-9β and S8R in the analysis of a cantilever beam under shear load. The geometry, boundary condition and material data are reported in Fig. 7
                        . The load P is applied as constant distribution along the side. Different length/height ratios using a mesh of two elements for regular and distorted geometries are considered. The results for regular mesh (d=0, see Fig. 7) in terms of displacements and nodal drilling rotation are reported in Tables 6 and 7
                        
                        . While, those for distorted meshes are listed in Tables 8 and 9
                        
                        . For the higher l/h ratios, using only two elements, the displacements obtained by HQ8-13β are too close to that evaluated for a beam like behavior, and coincide in terms of drilling rotations. For lower l/h the proposal is more flexible the HQ4-9β. In the case of distorted geometries, see Tables 8 and 9, the HQ8-13β is less sensitive to mesh distortion than HQ4-9β and S 8R.

The recovery of the rotation field plays a relevant role if the element is used, coupled with bending elements, in the analysis of folded plates and box structures, because of the coupling between in-plane and out-of-plane rotations of different elements, and when it is taken in buckling problems where nonlinear geometrical contributions are determined through a direct interpolation of the nodal rotations (see the discussion in [2]). This aspect is investigated here by referring to a simply supported beam (see Fig. 8
                        ) subjected to an external flexural moment in the end sections. The load is defined either through two nodal forces or through nodal drilling couples, denoted by P and M, respectively. The results, reported are compared in Table 10
                        , with those obtained using HQ4-9β, the element based on Hughes–Brezzi formulation [39] and the recent proposal in [44]. The reference solution has been evaluated using beam model. An overall good behavior for regular/distorted mesh is apparent and for the different load cases. In particular, the element HQ8-13β correctly differentiates between the nodal rotation

                         (see also [2]). In addition, the HQ8-13β element manifests less sensitivity to distorted geometry than all the other ones.

The accuracy and convergence of the HQ8-13β element in a context dominated by shear deformation and skew and tapered meshes is investigated here through the popular Cook׳s benchmark [45] (see Fig. 9
                        ). Results are shown in Tables 11 and 12
                        
                         and in Figs. 10 and 11
                        
                        , where the performance in terms of displacement and stress recovering of HQ8-13β is compared with other finite elements based available in the literature. The same good behavior is clear in the stress recovery along a line reported in Fig. 12
                        . We can note that the element already provides a satisfactory recovery solution recovering of the coarser meshes, which is a required goal for its setup.

This test refers to a square membrane with a circular hole. Due to the symmetry, only a quarter is analyzed. The geometrical data, boundary conditions and load are reported in Fig. 13
                        . The material data are E=20, ν=0.3 whit a thickness t=1. The test is helpful in order to check the behavior of the finite element in reproducing stress concentration and it is also reported in [6,46,47]. The structure has been analyzed with different HQ8-13β meshes. The analysis was also repeated with HQ4-9β and Abaqus S8R elements, for comparison. The results are shown in Figs. 14 and 15

                           y
                         along the horizontal and vertical symmetry lines. We can note the overall good behavior of HQ8-13β element in comparison with its competitors and, in particular its good recovery for coarse meshes.

The convergence of displacements and stresses in relevant points is reported in Table 13
                        , in comparison with the HQ4-9β and S8R elements. We can note, once more, the great accuracy provided by HQ8-13β, in particular the very low relative error for coarse mesh.

The last benchmark refers to a wall with rectangular openings, subjected to a horizontal loading. The geometry and the mechanical data are shown in Fig. 17
                        . Similar tests have been analyzed in many papers (see [32,35,36]). The analysis was performed with different meshes and repeated, for comparison, using the Abaqus S8R element and the results are shown in Table 14
                         and Fig. 18
                         which report the displacements and stresses in relevant points of the wall and the corresponding convergence graphs. The better performances of the proposed element are clear in the comparison: the rate of convergence often greater than h
                        2 and, more important, the error with respect to the reference solution is always lower, in particular for coarse meshes. The good behavior of the proposed element is further emphasized by the color maps of stresses N
                        
                           x
                         and N
                        
                           xy
                         shown in Fig. 19
                        . Note that the stresses recovery starts to be satisfactorily accurate at the coarsest mesh, confirming again the fulfillment of the required goals.

A new mixed (hybrid) quadrilateral 8-node, 16 DOFs membrane element, called HQ8-13β, was presented. Its purpose was to further improve the 4 node, 12DOFs HQ4-9β element in bending/shear solutions, and distorted geometry and coarse meshes. The new element maintains some of the main features of HQ4-9β: independent displacement and stress interpolations, use of Allman׳s drilling rotation kinematics and of internally self-equilibrated isostatic stress fields, the use of an incompatible cubic shape function to avoid range defectiveness. But it introduces two main novelties: (i) stresses are defined as a combination of Airy elastic solutions, so they define a kinematically compatible elastic strain field; (ii) four new DOFs are introduced expressing the longitudinal component of the displacement along each side of the element.

The first of these novelties plays an important role is reducing mesh distortion sensitivity in bending solutions. But also in obtaining the relevant element matrices, much more easily, through exact contour line integration. The second novelty adds to the element the ability to force continuity of the shear across inter-elements boundary, which in HQ4-9β and similar elements is only implicitly obtained by mesh refining. While being obtained with a minimum increase of the kinematical description (from 12 to 16 DOFs in the element), this provides a noticeable improvement in accuracy, particularly in the case of coarse meshes.

Several numerical tests have been performed to validate the element and check its performances, some of them, corresponding to classical benchmarks, have been reported in Section 4 including comparisons with other known elements available in the literature. The proposed element always shows good performances in all benchmarks and overtakes its competitors in the comparison. In fact, all benchmarks confirm the same expected convergence ratio of h
                     2, but also noticeably smaller absolute errors at the same mesh. This represents the main goal of the proposed element.

Apart from these, the element presents other advantages. As its ancestor HQ4-9β, the element format makes it suitable to be used as a membrane component of a shell element for the analysis of folded plates and box structures (see [10,11]). Moreover, the inter-element discontinuity of the assumed stress allows a pseudo-compatible external format in kinematical variables alone. This is open to the possibility of an easy reuse within commercial FEM codes. We can also affirm that the element is suitable for linear and geometrical nonlinear analyses of folded plates structures within a corotational formulation [10,11,48–50], because the rotation field is accurately recovered, avoiding the appearance of spurious modes [2].
