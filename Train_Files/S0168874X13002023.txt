                  The research goal is to develop a numerical method and computer code to inverse compute the multilayer moduli of a flexible pavement structure. A finite element model with infinite-elements on the infinite-half spaces of boundaries is developed to model pavement responses. A Newton–Raphson iteration procedure is proposed to inverse compute the multilayer moduli. Compared to most conventional analytical approaches it could account for temperature profile and associated modulus variation. A computer code is developed for the entire numerical computation. An average error of 1.77, 10.83, 8.99 and 1.08% is achieved for the inversed moduli of asphalt layer, base, subbase, and soil, respectively, based on 5000 dataset for validation. The method could also inverse compute the modulus variation of the top asphalt layer due to temperature profile, with an average error of 4.45% attained for three examples in cold, regular and hot weather conditions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Falling weight deflectometer (FWD) has been widely used for highway, parking lot and airport pavement structure evaluation [1]. Using FWD, a loading is applied on a circular plate sitting on the top of the pavement structure. The deflections on the surface of pavement structure are measured using several geophones with certain spacing [1], as shown in 
                     Fig. 1. For example, seven geophones are used to measure deflections at the distances of 0, 8in. (20.3cm), 12in. (30.5cm), 24in. (61.0cm), 36in. (91.4cm), 48in. (121.9cm), and 60in. (152.4cm). The FWD data, mainly “static data” or peak values of deflections and load pulses, are used to evaluate the structural capacity of pavements.

As often for the rehabilitation design purpose, the FWD loading and measured deflection basin of peak values (see Fig. 1) are also used to inverse compute (or back-calculate) the material properties, typically the layer elastic moduli [1].

Back-calculating pavement layer elastic moduli primarily involves two steps: (I) simulate pavement responses of deflections under the FWD loading; and (II) compute layer elastic moduli using the mathematical inverse algorithm, by minimizing the deflection difference between simulated results from step I and FWD measurements (or called as “observations”). This topic has been extensively studied and popular programs exist including the EverCalc developed by the Washington Department of Transportation (DOT) [2], The MODULUS developed by the Texas Transportation Institute [3], the MODCOMP 5 originally developed by the Cornell University with a DOS version and then updated by the Virginia DOT with a Windows version, the ELMOD developed by the Dynatest [4], and the MichiBack developed by the Michigan State University [5]. For these programs, the step I for simulating pavement response is based on the analytical multilayer elastic program. Other analytical approaches, such as the Vlasov or modified Vlasov models [6], are also used for the pavement response modeling during the back-calculation. The well-known multilayer elastic analysis programs include the ELSYM5 originally developed by the University of California at Berkeley and later adapted to microcomputers by Kopperman et al. [7], the BISAR developed by the Shell Global [8], and the Everstress developed by the University of Washington and Washington DOT [2], etc. However, these multilayer elastic analysis programs are unable to account for complex and variable boundary and loading conditions such as spatial variation of temperatures, and nonlinear material properties. In comparison, the finite element (FE) modeling could account for more complex boundary and loading conditions, and material properties. For step II, a variety of algorithms have been studied, such including the Kalman filter method [9], Newton method [2], neural network [10,11], least square [12], and system identification [13], data mining [14], co-variance matrix adaptation evolution strategy [15], Powell hybrid algorithm [16], and Ritz-vectors based method [17], etc. Poisson's ratio values of pavement materials are relatively stable and usually have very small effects on deflections [18], and thus they are usually assumed as constants rather than being back-calculated. In this paper, Poission's ratio values are also known and not back-calculated.

Back calculation of layer moduli, as a mathematical computation procedure, is regarded as an “art work” as it may achieve multiple moduli results all with qualified numerical accuracy (modeled responses vs. observations). However, it may not guarantee the engineering accuracy (inversed moduli vs. true values).

The goal of this research is to develop a numerical methodology and solution to inverse compute the elastic moduli of a multilayer pavement structure. Compared to most existing analytical approaches, the temperature profile and associated modulus variation of the asphalt layer is accounted. Specifically, a finite element model, with infinite elements for the infinite half-spaces of boundaries, will be developed to simulate the pavement responses. Consequently, a Newton–Raphson iteration procedure is proposed to inverse compute the layer elastic moduli, where the finite difference method is used to compute the gradient tensor. A computer code in FORTRAN language is developed for the numerical solution.

The FWD vertical loading is applied on a circular plate sitting on the surface of an airport or highway pavement. The pavement structure (highway, airport, and parking lot) under the FWD circular loading can be assumed as an axisymmetric body on the semi-infinite half-space of soil foundation at the bottom, with infinite half-spaces at the outer edges. This assumption is rational as: (1) the multilayer structure body is continuous; (2) material properties are considered homogeneous; (3) the soil foundation has infinite depth; and (4) the dimension size of the multilayer is much larger than the FWD loading area (e.g. the parking lot size compared to the 15cm-radius of the FWD loading plate). Therefore, it has been a common practice to assume the axisymmetric model under the circular FWD or vehicle loading for calculating pavement responses by using the multilayer analysis programs [2,7,8], and national pavement analysis and design methods [18–20]. 
                        Fig. 2 shows the half axisymmetric FE model of the pavement domain, boundary and loading conditions. The FWD loading f is applied on the surface of the axisymmetric center.

The stress equilibrium for a three-dimensional (3-D) model based on the cylindrical coordinate system is expressed as follows [21]:

The mechanical behavior and modulus of the top HMA (hot mix asphalt) layer is temperature dependent [24], while the modulus of the unbound materials (base/subbase and soil) can be regarded as constants [18]. In the FE model the temperature profile and associated modulus variation of HMA layer is accounted. According to the national AASHTO 93 design method, the HMA modulus is temperature dependent as follows [19,25]:

In the FE model, the temperature values are read in at different depth, and then the modulus at that depth and element is calibrated according to the above equation.

An inverse computation procedure is proposed as follows. As compared to existing methods discussed earlier [9–17], the proposed method uses the developed FE model to simulate pavement responses, and a Newton–Raphson method with empirically estimated moduli as initial seed values for the inversion computation.

The initial moduli seed values could be any positive values within a fairly wide range. However, as mentioned earlier a variety of inversed moduli results may be attained all with acceptable numerical accuracies but with different engineering accuracy. Therefore, initial seed values that penalize or constrain the initial moduli seed ranges according to the engineering judgment would be recommended to improve the engineering accuracy of inverse computation. The Long Term Pavement Performance program (LTPP) database has provided massive amounts of information for the pavement structures and material properties including the layer elastic moduli [28]. LTPP is based on a comprehensive 20-year study of in-service pavements, monitoring more than 2400 asphalt and Portland cement concrete pavement test sections across the U.S. and Canada. 
                           Table 1 summarizes the moduli value range resulted from the LTPP program for a four-layer pavement structure with the HMA as surface layer, crushed stone as the base layer, gravel material as the subbase layer, and soil or subgrade. These moduli ranges represent variable properties of pavement materials. The moduli seed values and inversed layer moduli are constrained within these ranges in this study.

Here the empirical “area method” [28] is adopted to estimate the initial moduli seed values for the HMA layer in order to improve engineering accuracy. The area method is used to roughly estimate the layer moduli of a pavement structure according to the FWD measured deflection and geophone distances [29], following the “area concept” proposed in the national AASHTO 93 pavement design guideline [19]. The “area” is used to characterize the deflection basin, and the area method is described as follows.

The Boussinesq's analytical solution [30] is used to compute the deflection u on the top of earth or soil foundation — an infinite half-space structure, under a circular loading as follows:

With the estimated initial moduli seed values as material parameter inputs, the FE simulation is performed to determine pavement deflections as discussed early. The FE numerical solution will be further detailed later.

The Newton–Raphson method is used to iterate, and update the moduli seeds until the numerical accuracy is satisfied. The iteration goal is to minimize the deflection difference between observations (or measurements) and FE modeling results.

The gradient tensor for the inverse computation is defined as follows:

The inverse iteration will continue until the RMS value satisfies the numerical error target (e.g. 3%).

The finite element (FE) method is used to solve the PDE (partial differential equation) controlled state equation for determining the deflection variable u. A FORTRAN computer coding is developed for the entire numerical solution of FE model and inverse computation.

The 8-nodel isoparametric ring element [23] is adopted to simulate the main body of the axisymmetric domain, as shown in 
                           Fig. 3(a). The infinite elements are used to simulate the infinite half-spaces of boundaries at the far right side along the radial direction (Fig. 3(b)) and the bottom of soil foundation along the depth direction (Fig. 3(c)). A sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the element size, and at the loading area and HMA layer a fine size of 3cm×3cm is used (node to node distance is 1.5cm).

The two-times polynomial shape function is used for the 8-node ring element as follows [23,26]:

By assembling the stiffness matrix of each element to the global domain, the global linear system is achieved as follows to determine deflection u:
                              
                                 (29)
                                 
                                    K
                                    u
                                    =
                                    F
                                 
                              
                           where, K=the global stiffness matrix; F=the global body force and external loading term discretized to FE nodes.

The stiffness matrix K is positive definite, and the matrix can be banded by gathering only the non-zero terms to reduce the data storage space and accelerate the computation speed. In order to minimize the bandwidth size, the element numbers and nodes are aligned with increasing order along the radius direction, as shown in 
                           Fig. 4 for an example of a four-element domain. The K matrix is then decomposed to the upper and lower triangular matrixes (L and U, respectively) following the LU factorization rule, and thus the linear system of Eq. (29) can be re-expressed as follows:
                              
                                 (30)
                                 
                                    L
                                    U
                                    u
                                    =
                                    f
                                 
                              
                           
                        

Consequently, the linear system is solved following two steps in sequence for finding y vector and then u deflection vector:
                              
                                 (31)

At each iteration step, pavement deflections are computed, and the Newton–Raphson inversion is performed to compute the layer elastic moduli. A computer code in FORTRAN language is developed for the entire numerical computation. Two main FORTRAIN modules are designed for the core computations: (1) the FE modeling; and (2) the Newton–Raphon inverse computing. 
                           Fig. 5 presents the flow chart for the computation procedure. The inputs include the pavement structure parameters of layer thicknesses and material Poisson's ratio values, the guessed initial moduli seed values, and the FWD loading. Typical Poisson's ratio values are used in this study, i.e. 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, and 0.45 for HMA, base, subbase, and soil, respectively [18]. The FWD measured deflection data are read in as observations. Consequently, the FE modeling is performed to compute the pavement responses of deflections, followed by the Newton–Raphson inverse computation to determine the layer moduli. This iteration procedure repeats and the moduli values are updated until the numerical error is acceptable (e.g. RMS<3%).

To validate the proposed method and numerical solution, “true” pavement structures and layer moduli are designed. According to the LTPP program, a typical four-layer pavement structure is used for validation, named case I as shown in 
                     Table 2. Case II uses half size of the HMA layer thickness of case I to study the effects of HMA layer thickness. Case III and IV use lower moduli for subbase while higher moduli for soil, with the same and half size of HMA layer thickness of case I, respectively. Case III and IV are designed to study the effects of the moduli of subbase and soil.

To validate the engineering accuracy, a large dataset of true moduli of case I pavement structure is randomly generated for testing. These include 5000 randomly generated moduli values for each of HMA, base, subbase, and soil layer. These moduli values are assumed to follow a normal distribution [19], with a coefficent of variance of 30%, as shown in 
                     Fig. 6. A very small portion of moduli values is fallen beyond the LTPP program range and thus filtered out.

Note that in this study the laboratory testing of real material is not performed to validate the inversion results due to following reasons. The laboratory testing conditions are very different than the in-situ situations including the loading frequency and material confined conditions used in the FE simulation. Meanwhile, the sample preparation from field via coring is destructive for highway system and highly costly. Therefore, rather than using the laboratory validation, a theoretical validation procedure is proposed. Two validations are proposed as follows:
                        
                           (1)
                           Validation of the FE simulated responses: the well-known ELSYM5 multilayer analytical program is used for validation. ELSYM5 solution is based on the multilayer linear elastic theory, for an axisymmetric model with infinite half-space [7]. It is a well-known program and has been widely used for pavement analysis. The FE model developed in this research is also based on an axisymmetric model with infinite half-space considering linear elastic material properties, and infinite elements at the boundaries are used to model the infinite half-space. Therefore, both methods are based on the same model and linear elastic theory, and the classic analytical solution could be used to validate the FE numerical solution.

Validation of the inversed moduli: first with the inputs of randomly generated true moduli values the pavement deflections can be calculated as the “observations”. Then the true moduli values are completely “forgotten”. Consequently, based on the “observations” the numerical inversion is performed to determine the inversed moduli. Finally, the inversed moduli are compared with the true moduli values to verify the engineering accuracy.

The FE modeled response results are validated by the commercial software, and then the inversed moduli results are validated and discussed.


                        
                        Fig. 7(a)–(d) presents the FE modeled vertical deflections for the pavement structures of case I–IV, respectively. Results show that case III and IV have lower deflection values due to their higher soil moduli as compared to that of case I and II. Case II has the largest deflection value due to its lowest HMA thickness and soil moduli. 
                        Fig. 8 presents the FE simulated deflections at those geophone distances as compared to the ELSYM5 analytical solution results, indicating a very close matching and therefore validating the FE model.


                           
                           Fig. 9 shows the modeled deflection basin as compared to the observations at the last iteration step (with a RMS of 3%), indicating a very close matching and reasonable numerical accuracy. Different RMS targets are used for the numerical inversion, i.e. 1, 5, 9, and 19%. 
                           Fig. 10 shows the inversed moduli as compared to the true values using different RMS targets. Results indicate that a lower RMS target results in improved engineering accuracy, and vice versa.


                           
                           Fig. 11 shows the final iteration steps versus RMS targets. As expected the iteration steps generally decrease with the increase of RMS target value, but the effect of RMS target is less significant when its value gets relatively high (e.g. 7% or higher). Based on these results, a RMS target of 5% or lower value would be recommended for engineering application when using this numerical method.


                           
                           Fig. 12 shows the inversed moduli at different iteration steps. It shows that inversed moduli usually gradually approach the true values with the increase of iteration steps, though at some cases (e.g. for the HMA moduli) it may reverse the search direction first and then come back to approach the true value. It is also noted that the inversed moduli values always show the same sign (either be lower or higher than true values for all iteration steps), indicating a stable convergence using this numerical procedure.


                           
                           Fig. 13(a)–(c) represents inversed moduli using random moduli as seed values (e.g. low-bounded values of the LTPP program's range), area method estimated moduli, and inversed moduli using area-method estimated moduli as seed values, respectively. 
                           Fig. 14 shows the inversed moduli of base, subbase, and soil using random initial moduli seed values. 
                           Table 3 summarizes the statistics of engineering error (difference percentage between inversed moduli and true values).

These case studies indicate that moduli seed values play a critical role on the engineering accuracy for the HMA layer moduli. This would be due to HMA moduli's relatively large variation and their significant effects on pavement deflections. However, results show that the numerical accuracy is not sensitive to moduli seed values. For example, the RMS is 2.12% and 2.22% for the inversed results using the random moduli values as seeds and using the area-method estimated moduli as seeds, respectively. Fig. 13 results indicate that the inversed HMA moduli with the area-method-estimated moduli as seeds have the highest engineering accuracy. For example, it has an engineering error of only 1.77%, apparently lower than 16.69 and 5.55% resulting from the area method and the inversion results using random moduli seeds, respectively. Results also indicate that the inversed moduli of the unbound materials (base, subbase and soil) are much less sensitive to the moduli seed values as compared to that of HMA layer, which might be due to their smaller variations and less effects on pavement deflections.

To account for the temperature profile effects, three examples with three weather conditions are implemented for the case I structure: (1) cold weather; (2) regular weather; and (3) hot weather. The temperature profile data of HMA layer at 2:00PM and 8:00PM of each example are extracted and estimated from the LTPP data [28] at the Montana State (cold weather), Delaware State (regular weather), and Arizona State (hot weather) as shown in 
                           Fig. 15. The temperature ranges are from −9.19°C to −1.84°C, 14.66°C to 32.32°C, and 36.16°C to 58.68°C for the cold, regular, and hot weather, respectively. The hot weather has the highest temptation variation (22.52°C difference at 2:00PM), then the regular weather (16.92°C difference at 2:00PM), and the cold weather has the lowest temperature variation (5.99°C difference at 2:00PM).


                           
                           Fig. 16 shows the inversed moduli profile of HMA as compared to the true values. Results indicate that inversed moduli values could match true values, with an average error of 4.45%. For the cold weather the inversed moduli are a little over-predicted while for the regular weather they are a little under-predicted at 8:00PM. 
                           Fig. 17 shows the simulated deflections on the surface of top HMA layer. Results indicate that deflection at 2:00PM is lower than that at 8:00PM primarily at the zero or close distances, and this difference decreases with increase of distance until two deflections merge together. This observation could be explained by temperature variations at different times, while at far distances deflections are primarily dependent on the moduli of underneath layers which are considered temperature independent. The hot weather condition has the highest deflection values and deflection difference between 2:00PM and 8:00PM, then the regular weather, and cold weather due to their temperature values and variations along depths.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this research a numerical method and procedure is developed to inverse compute the elastic moduli of the multilayer pavement structure. A FE model with infinite-elements for the infinite half-spaces of boundaries is developed to model pavement response of deflections. Consequently, a Newton–Raphson iteration procedure is proposed to inverse compute the layer moduli. Compared to most conventional existing analytical approaches this developed method could account for the temperature profile and associated modulus variation of HMA layer. The entire numerical computation is coded in FORTRAN language for the numerical solution. 5000 randomly generated moduli values for each layer of a four-layer pavement structure are used as true values for validation purpose. Three projects and examples in the cold, regular, and hot weather conditions with temperature profile variations are also implemented. Results indicate that the developed numerical approach has a stable convergence. A 5% or lower value of RMS target is recommended for the engineering application when using this method. The moduli seed values seem to have very small effects on the numerical accuracy (modeled deflection values versus observations). However, the moduli seed values play a critical role in the engineering accuracy (inversed moduli values versus true values) for the HMA layer. With these 5000 randomly generated moduli values for each layer, an engineering error of 1.77% for the inversed moduli of HMA layer is achieved. The inversed moduli of unbound materials (base, subbase, and soil) are much less sensitive to the initial moduli seed values as compared to that of the HMA layer. Using the random moduli seed values, an engineering error of 10.83, 8.99, and 1.08% are observed for the inversed moduli of base, subbase, and soil, respectively. The computational method could also inverse compute the modulus variation of HMA layer due to temperature profile, with an average error of 4.45% attained for three examples.
