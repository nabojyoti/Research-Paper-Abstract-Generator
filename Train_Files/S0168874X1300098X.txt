                  When creating simplified models of the vehicle structure, 1D beam elements are normally used to obtain a small-sized and parametric representation of all beam-like parts. Despite its undoubted advantages, such an approach can introduce certain modeling errors. They are influenced by various factors such as cross-section deformations, spot welds, flanges, discontinuities and beam cross-section geometry. The aim of this paper is to perform a systematic study of these error factors and their potential impact on the model accuracy. Consequently, guidelines are given on good practices for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of 1D beam concept modeling techniques. For this purpose six different beam structures with idealized geometry are studied. Furthermore, three beam-like parts of a vehicle body are also investigated. The derived good modeling practices are applied to a couple of industrial case-studies, both at car body level. By giving a better insight of the potential pitfalls and their possible solutions, 1D beam concept modeling can become more accurate and reliable.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The automotive virtual prototyping process is becoming more and more demanding in terms of time, costs and product quality. Vehicle concept modeling is increasingly recognized as an important part of the design chain. It is used to identify and apply modifications already in the early design stages, leading to shorter development time, lower cost and better products. Thus various concept modeling methodologies are being actively developed. The methods based on concept Finite Element (FE) equivalent of the structure are among the most popular ones [1–14]. They principally aim to create a simplified beam, joint and panel (BJP) representation of the detailed FE model of an existing vehicle. In some cases it is also possible to start with a concept model “from scratch”. The resulting small-sized and parametric concept models are then used to perform fast structural optimization in order to improve the vehicle static and dynamic performance.

Despite their advantages, the methods using simplified structure layout can introduce some errors related to the modeling of beams, joints, panels and the connections between them. This work is focused on the error resulting from the concept representation of beams. They are an important component group used to simplify the main load-carrying structure of the vehicle. Beam-like members are often the first to be simplified and added to the concept model and, normally, they are substituted with 1D beam elements [1–13]. This simplification leads to a significant reduction in the number of elements and nodes with respect to the initial shell mesh. However, it can cause various discrepancies between the detailed FE model and its concept equivalent. Concept models with 1D beams result stiffer than their detailed FE counterparts as they do not take into account the local cross-section deformations. Additional differences can occur because of factors such as flanges, spot welds, stiffeners and discontinuities in the reference FE model, which are heavily simplified or not considered in the concept model. The type of the 1D beam cross-section is also important as it influences the accuracy of approximating the real cross-section properties. Various solutions have been proposed to tackle these issues: better modeling alternatives [2,3,6,12], model updating [2,7–9], correction factors [1,5,6,13]. However, in all these works, the problem is only partially addressed and solved. Still no holistic approach exists. The purpose of this paper is to serve as a basis to improve 1D beam concept modeling by giving a better insight into its major bottlenecks. Based on the systematic study of various beam typologies, general guidelines are derived to reduce the modeling errors. Thus, the already fast BJP methods can also become more accurate and they can result in more reliable early-stage predictions.

This paper is organized as follows. The used methodology is described in Section 2 and it is then applied to various idealized and non-idealized case-studies in Section 3. Based on the derived guidelines, an existing body-in-white (BIW) concept model is studied in Section 4.1. Finally, a hybrid detailed-concept FE model of a BIW is created and analyzed in Section 4.2.

This section focuses on the quality of the 1D beam models. The main criteria to evaluate it are considered, as well as the major error factors that can deteriorate it.

To assess the performance of a specific 1D beam concept model, two main aspects must be taken into account. On one hand, its structural behavior must be as close as possible to the one of its corresponding detailed FE model, thus resulting in better prediction capabilities. On the other hand, a geometry match between the detailed and the concept model must be also ensured. The fulfillment of this second condition is especially important for optimization studies so that the optimized concept model could be used to find the optimized detailed FE model [12]. These two important considerations are discussed hereafter.

1D beam models are simpler and computationally more efficient than models with 2D shell or 3D solid meshes. In consequence, beam theories are extensively used for various engineering applications regarding the static and dynamic analysis of structures [15]. Many methods have been proposed each of which relying on different assumptions and simplifications and resulting in different accuracy of the concept models.

The beam theories of Euler–Bernoulli [16,17], de Saint-Venant [18,19], and Timoshenko [20,21] represent the group of classical approaches. In contrast to its two predecessors, Timoshenko's model accounts also for transverse shear deformations. However, none of the three considers non-classical effects such as in- and out-of-plane cross-section deformations and torsion-bending coupling. The application of the classical methods for cases in which such effects are present can lead to wrongly estimated structural stiffness. This has been the main motivation for the further development of refined beam theories during the last years.

Various solutions have been proposed to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the conventional approaches. They rely on different techniques: the introduction of shear correction factors, the use of warping functions based on the de Saint-Venant's solution, the variational asymptotic solution, generalized beam theories and higher-order beam models. A comprehensive state-of-the-art can be found in [15]. Despite the attempts to extend the applicability of 1D beam modeling, few of these works have led to a fully functional and tested commercial software to be used by the engineering community. The proposed approaches are often developed and validated for specific academic case-studies, but their performance in more general cases is not guaranteed.

For the purposes of this work Timoshenko's beam theory was used, extended with an additional DOF accounting for warping [22,23]. Thus 1D beams have 7 DOFs at each end node—three translations T, three rotations R and one DOF approximating the cross-section deformation due to torsional warping. A commercial solution was chosen—MD Nastran 2010 [24]. On one hand, the limitations of this approach restrict also the current study. On the other hand, it is widely used in the automotive industry. Moreover, the choice of a single method can be considered reasonable because of the impossibility to apply and compare the numerous beam theories in a single paper.

Regarding the geometry description of the 1D beam cross-sections, three main approaches can be distinguished using standard cross-sections (STCS) [2,3,7–11], arbitrary cross-sections (ABCS) [3,12] and generic cross-sections (GNCS) [1,4–6,13]. An extensive state-of-the-art can be found in [12]. Fig. 1
                            shows an example of simplifying the A-pillar of a Ford Taurus FE model with 1D beams having STCS, ABCS and GNCS. In this figure the STCS and the ABCS beams are visualized in detailed 1D element display to evidence the difference with respect to the GNCS.

The STCS method offers a predefined library with simplified versions of the most common cross-section typologies (e.g. box, tube, I-, C-shape). For each 1D beam element the STCS shape is chosen that best approximates the projection of the real cross-section on a plane perpendicular to the 1D beam axis (Fig. 1). Given the irregularity of the beam cross-sections in a car body, this approach is not always appropriate, despite its simplicity. Moreover, the backward transition to the optimized detailed FE model can become problematic.

In the ABCS approach the real cross-section is described with points, segments and their corresponding thicknesses (Fig. 1). Thus it is possible to control the degree of detail. The cross-section description can range from a simple rectangle enclosing the real shape to a geometry that matches it almost perfectly. A fully detailed ABCS will have the same geometry and cross-sectional properties as the projection of the reference cross-section. This facilitates the transition from the optimized concept model to the optimized detailed FE model.

In contrast to the previous two methods, the GNCS approach keeps no information about the geometry of the cross-section. Instead, it is substituted with its equivalent cross-sectional properties such as area and moments of inertia (Fig. 1). Although this equivalent generic cross-section can be still accurate, the direct relation with the detailed FE model is broken.

There are many factors which could influence the accuracy of the concept model regarding its structural behavior and geometrical similarity with the reference structure. Those considered as the most important ones are discussed hereafter. They will be subject of a detailed study in Section 3.

As out-of-plane deformations are approximated by the employed beam theory [22,23], they are not a subject of study in this work. Regarding the in-plane cross-section distortion, a new measure is hereby proposed to quantify it. The procedure for its calculation is the following:
                              
                                 •
                                 A control node C is defined for the cross-section under study (reference detailed FE model). It can be positioned in the cross-section centroid or shear center, as well as in any other point. The coordinates

                                     of all N nodes belonging to the cross-section are obtained from the FE model. The three translational and rotational components of each node are obtained after linear static analysis is performed. Thus the matrices

                           Fig. 2
                            illustrates the final result of the procedure described above applied to a B-pillar cross-section. In Section 3 
                           ICDM is calculated for all beam case-studies.

The approximation of the reference cross-sections in the 1D beam model is decisive for the concept accuracy. In case that the reference geometry can be completely matched by STCS, the performance will be the same as that of an ABCS model. The difference between these two techniques is clearly pronounced in the frequent case of non-standard cross-sections. Typically the beam-like parts of the BIW are highly irregular, non-prismatic and with various internal layers and stiffeners. The bigger the discrepancies introduced by STCS with respect to the true cross-section properties, the bigger is the error not only at local level, but also regarding the structural behavior of the whole concept model. It is preferable to perform the simplification of such reference FE models with ABCS. They allow the designer to achieve the desired balance between accuracy and complexity of the concept model by varying the level of detail in the cross-section description. GNCS are not considered in this work. Although they can reach good accuracy for any cross-section, the relation to the geometry is lost, which is undesirable, especially for concept optimization studies.

To study this error factor three beam structures with non-standard cross-section geometry are presented in Section 3.1. Two types of concept models are created for each of them using STCS and ABCS and their performance is compared. In Section 3.2, more complex structures are studied, made up of several thin metal sheets and internal stiffeners.

The presence of structural discontinuities in the detailed FE model can be the cause of inaccuracies in the concept one. The error depends on how abrupt the transition is in both models. The more different the cross-section properties of the two adjacent beam structures (e.g. box to C-shape cross-section), the more the error is expected to increase. The usage of STCS modeling could further deteriorate the problem, being a method less accurate than ABCS. In many cases the design engineer is forced to increase the discrepancy between the actual and the modeled cross-sections because of the limited typologies available in the predefined library. As a consequence, transitions which are smooth in the reference FE model become abrupt in a STCS concept model, additionally increasing the modeling error.

To study the influence of this error factor two irregular beam structures with alternating open and closed cross-sections are considered (Section 3.1), for which both STCS and ABCS modeling are applied. Furthermore, a B-pillar having discontinuities is studied in Section 3.2.

Spot welds are the predominant joining method in the automotive industry. Thin steel metal sheets are assembled into vehicle components by means of spot welding. Thus a typical vehicle BIW can contain several thousands of spot-welded joints. They have a significant influence on important performance attributes such as global modes, static stiffness, durability and crashworthiness performance [13,25,26]. For this reason spot welds have to be considered in the detailed FE model of the vehicle. A state-of-the-use review of the various modeling techniques can be found in [27]. Furthermore, because of its importance, the spot weld layout is often subject to multi-disciplinary optimization [26].

The beam-like parts of the BIW are not an exception. They are made of formed steel shells, which are joined together by spot welding along their lip flanges (Fig. 3
                           (a)). In the concept FE model the segments of the 1D beam cross-section corresponding to the spot welds in the detailed FE model have to be closed (Fig. 3(b)). This has to be performed even for the most accurate ABCS description in order to ensure the continuity of the concept cross-section and in the same time the connection of the metal sheets. This approximation decreases the accuracy of the concept model, as the actual distribution of the spot welds is considerably sparser and the real structure is more flexible.

Furthermore, in industrial problems it is a common practice to neglect the lip flanges in the concept model [3,12], e.g. Fig. 3(c). The reason is that when ABCS are used, the whole cross-section is rescaled in the optimization process [3,12,28]. If the cross-section contains flanges, their size is also changed, which on the other hand is undesirable as their main function is to allow the spot welding of two metal sheets. The resizing of the flanges can make the properties of the 1D beam cross-sections as well as the mass of the whole structure unfeasible and not realistic.

To assess the influence of these two interrelated error factors, several beam-like parts of the BIW are considered (Section 3.2). The performance of concept models both with and without flanges is compared. Additionally, modified detailed models are created and compared with the reference ones. Their aim is to mimic the concept modeling of spot welds by adding more connections between the nodes at the flange borders.

In this section two groups of beam structures are studied at component level: idealized and non-idealized ones. Thanks to its intentional simplicity, the first group serves to distinguish unambiguously the influence of some of the error factors introduced in Section 2.2. On its turn, the second group includes more problematic and realistic cases taken directly from the vehicle BIW, for which all studied factors are relevant.

Six different 2D shell models were subject to simplification with 1D beams. Because of the simple geometry, there was a perfect match between them. The corresponding detailed models (DM) and concept models (CM) are displayed in Fig. 4
                           . These six cases are a representative but not exhaustive selection of cross-section typologies, given their wide variety in the vehicle shell BIW [12]. All beams are prismatic, 0.5m long and made of steel with plate thickness of 2mm. Three of them have standard profile (1–3) while the rest have a non-standard one (4–6). In addition, they can be divided into closed (1 and 4), open (2 and 5) and mixed open/closed (3 and 6) cases. For the cases with non-standard profile (4–6) three additional 1D beam models with STCS (

                              CM
                              
                                 
                                    ′
                                 
                                 
                                    6
                                 
                              
                           ) were also considered in order to compare their performance with their ABCS counterparts (CM
                           4–CM
                           6). Each of them was created as a bounding box around its corresponding DM. Their masses were kept the same as those of the DM by adjusting the shell thickness of each STCS model accordingly. Such an approach is considered a good practice as having different masses is not desirable for the dynamic load cases. For all 1D beam structures from Fig. 4 the origin of each element coordinate system was placed at the shear center of its corresponding cross-section. Moreover, the axes of all these local coordinate systems (x, y and z) were aligned with the axes of the global coordinate system O

These additional models were considered in order to study the relation between the modeling error and the size variation of the same beam, which normally occurs during structural optimization. To apply these structural modifications on the detailed FE models, indirect mesh morphing via morph volumes was used. In the concept models, it was sufficient to change the cross-section parameters (STCS) or rescale accordingly the bounding box around the cross-section (ABCS). The shear center offsets were also updated where appropriate.

Seven static load cases were defined both for the detailed FE and the concept models. They are schematically presented in Fig. 5

Various load value configurations were possible according to several plausible criteria. For the purposes of the current study the BIW concept FE model of an existing vehicle was analyzed for different global static load cases. The loads generated in all 1D beam elements were extracted and the corresponding frequency distributions were obtained. Finally, the values of F

                            were chosen based on the most frequent values, corresponding approximately to 90% of the 1D elements. The loads showed the following ratios for forces in Newtons and moments in Newton millimeters: 1:1:1:100:100:50.

Each 1D beam structure had 11 control nodes (Fig. 5(b)), of which the resulting translations and rotations were measured. As the concept and the detailed model differed in terms of DOFs and FE mesh, model matching was performed by adding rigid (Nastran RBE2) and interpolation (Nastran RBE3) elements in the detailed model. The RBE2 (magenta) connected the nodes of the cross-sections at both beam ends, whereas the RBE3 (black) connected the nodes of the intermediate cross-sections along the beam length (Fig. 5(a)). Both the rigid and the interpolation elements were created in correspondence with the cross-sections at the control nodes in the concept model. Moreover, the independent nodes of the RBE2 and the dependent ones of the RBE3 were the same 11 control nodes as in the concept model.

Linear static analysis was performed with MD Nastran for all 6 beam cases (DM, CM, 
                              CM
                              ′
                           )—reference and resized configurations. The values of the applied forces and moments (Fig. 5) were not changed. The translational and rotational components of the displacement vectors were extracted for the 11 control nodes in each model (Fig. 5). ICDM was calculated for the 9 non-rigid cross-sections along the beam length corresponding to the intermediate control nodes.

                            show the results for the reference configurations 1–6 (generic load case). These figures have two Y -axes. The one on the left is for the magnitudes of the translational components T of all control nodes, and the one on the right is for the magnitudes of their rotational components R. As expected, there is a stiffness overestimation in the CM for all six cases, although the difference greatly varies according to the cross-section geometry. The difference with respect to the DM results bigger for R. For the closed cross-section beams (cases 1 and 4) there is almost no error introduced by the CM as the structural behavior of CM and DM practically coincides (Figs. 6 and 9). The discrepancies increase for the open cross-section beams (cases 2 and 5), which can be explained with the higher cross-section distortion in the DM, unaccounted for in the CM.

However, the highest errors are observed for cases 3 and 6 which have both open and closed cross-sections (Figs. 8 and 11). The results can be partially attributed to the abrupt change in the cross-sectional properties at each transition node. Figs. 12–14
                           
                           
                            show the ICDM along the beam length for cases 1, 2 and 3 respectively (reference configurations). ICDM is zero for the first cross-section corresponding to the constraint, as well as for the last cross-section because of the rigid element connecting its nodes (Nastran RBE2). While in Figs. 12 and 13 there is a gradual change in the ICDM, various peaks can be noted in Fig. 14. They correspond to the nodes in which there is a transition open/closed cross-section, i.e. 3, 5, 7, 9, 10 (Fig. 4). Moreover, the less different the cross-section geometries at the transition, the smaller the modeling error. Thus CM
                           6 (Fig. 11) performs better than CM
                           3 (Fig. 8).

Similar to the reference models, the lowest errors (less than 1%) are observed for the closed beams (CM
                           1 and CM
                           4), for all resized configurations. The errors increase for CM
                           2, CM
                           5 and CM
                           6 but they are still less than 10%. On its turn, CM
                           3 results again the most erroneous because of the abrupt change in the cross-sectional properties at the transitions. Although such a difference still persists in CM
                           6, it is smaller, resulting thus in a smaller error. Finally,

The highest ICDM sums resulting from the first three load cases determined the dominant forces (Table 8), while the highest ICDM sums resulting from the latter three load cases determined the dominant moments (Table 9). As for the highest error contributions (Tables 6 and 7), the loads with the biggest influence on the ICDM are M

For all beams with open only or both open and closed cross-sections, torsion is the cause for the highest in-plane cross-section deformations and also for the highest errors with the used beam theory. Its influence on the concept model accuracy will be discussed for an industrial case-study in Section 4.1. On the other hand, not only M

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

As confirmed by the results, the in-plane cross-section deformations, the cross-section type and the discontinuities can deteriorate the concept model accuracy to a different extent. The following guidelines can be given:
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    In-plane cross-section deformations: If unaccounted for in the employed beam theory, they are partially responsible for the overestimation of the beam stiffness. They are of significant importance for 1D beams subject to torsion and can be the cause for model inaccuracy. In this regard, 1D beams with open cross-sections can become a source for errors in the concept model, because of their lower torsional stiffness and bigger in-plane distortions with respect to closed profiles. For these reasons the quantification of the in-plane deformation is important and must be applied where possible. Measures as ICDM can be used to determine the load resulting in the highest cross-section deformations. ICDM can be used as an additional tool for detailed analysis of problematic cases at single beam level (e.g. structures with abrupt cross-section change). Finally, the cross-section distortion can be visualized (Fig. 2).


                                    Beam cross-section geometry: STCS are appropriate for simple academic case-studies with regular beam geometry. They can be also used for beams with non-standard cross-section profile, but only if the difference between the properties of the actual cross-section and the STCS is negligible. The usage of STCS in the general case of non-standard cross-section shape is inappropriate and it can lead to significant difference with respect to the actual structural stiffness which can be both under- or overestimated. For such structures, ABCS are the preferable choice as they give better approximation of the real geometry and higher accuracy.


                                    Discontinuities: Big discontinuities resulting in very different adjacent cross-section properties can be the cause for considerable modeling errors. For detailed models with such parts of the structure, special attention must be paid when creating the concept model and its accuracy must be controlled afterwards. If the number and type of the discontinuities in the same model cannot be considered negligible, advanced modeling improvements must be developed and applied. One possible solution with the currently used beam theory could be the use of additional beam elements at both sides of the transition with interpolated cross-section properties in order to provide a smoother change from open to closed geometry and vice-versa.

The A-pillar, the windshield header and the B-pillar of a Toyota Rav4 were subject to simplification with 1D beams. All three of them are non-prismatic steel structures with complex geometry and varying properties. The corresponding detailed models (DM) and concept models (CM) are displayed in Fig. 15
                           . Similar to the idealized beam structures, closed (7), open (8) and mixed open/closed (9) cases can be distinguished.

Based on the conclusions made in Section 3.1.3, 1D beams with ABCS were used to represent the non-standard profiles of the real cross-sections and guarantee a good match. In this regard, a generally applicable rule-of-thumb was defined and used to decrease the cross-section complexity of ABCS where needed by creating equivalent shell layers. Let L
                           1 and L
                           2 be two adjacent stamped sheets such as the ones in the upper part of Fig. 3(a), which have similar dimensions and are made of the same material. Let L
                           1 be the external layer and let L
                           2 be the internal one. Moreover, let t
                           1, S
                           1 and V
                           1 be the thickness, area and volume of the L
                           1 component, while similarly t
                           2, S
                           2 and V
                           2 are the thickness, area and volume of the L
                           2 component respectively. To simplify the ABCS, L
                           2 must be removed and its equivalent thickness must be added to t
                           1. The thickness, area and volume of the new equivalent layer are noted as

In order to study the influence of the flanges, three additional concept models were created—

                           . As it can be seen in Fig. 15, the flanges of the detailed FE models were not modeled in the corresponding simplified ones. Furthermore, two modified detailed FE models were also considered—

                           . Thus the gaps between the flange borders became as if they were closed, given that all nodes belonging to them were connected.

                           8 contained just a few spot welds connecting the main stamped sheet to a stiffener.

The biggest errors are observed for the windshield header, but still they are under 5% which is acceptable for the purposes of a concept study. The smaller discrepancies for the A- and the B-pillar confirm the feasibility of the above defined rule for creating equivalent shell layers (Eq. (6)). However the relative percentage errors increase considerably for the concept models without flanges (

A generic static load case was defined both for the detailed FE and the concept models. It contained the same load types as shown in Fig. 5: three moments (M

                              z
                           ). The same characteristic ratios were used for their values as explained in Section 3.1.1. The loads were applied on the neutral axis of the end cross-section and were parallel to the axes of the local coordinate system O
                           
                              xyz
                            of the end beam element. Each 1D beam structure had different number of control nodes, the resulting translations and rotations of which were measured. To match the DOFs of the detailed and the concept models the same technique was applied as in Section 3.1. Each detailed model was modified so that rigid elements connected the nodes of the cross-sections at both beam ends, while interpolation elements connected the nodes of the intermediate cross-sections along the beam. Thus the control nodes in the detailed model were defined again as the independent nodes of the RBE2 and the dependent ones of the RBE3 elements.

@&#RESULTS@&#

As for the idealized beam cases, linear static analysis was performed for all reference and concept structures (Fig. 15), applying the same loads. ICDM was calculated for the cross-sections corresponding to the control node locations. The translational and rotational components of the displacement vectors were extracted for the control nodes in each model. The results for the three cases under study are shown in Figs. 16–18

                           8 and the main trends for the translations and rotations are followed, the performance of the concept B-pillar is not satisfactory. There are large discrepancies between the detailed and the concept model, as all error factors are present, including the transition from open to closed cross-sections. As for the idealized beams the latter factor proved to be a significant one, a similar methodology was applied for its study by computing the variation of the ICDM along the B-pillar (Fig. 19
                           ). ICDM is zero for the first cross-section corresponding to the constraint, as well as for the last cross-section because of the rigid element connecting its nodes. The transitions between open and closed cross-sections in DM
                           9 occur at control nodes 3, 4 and 6. Similar to

                            (Fig. 14), also in Fig. 19 the abrupt transitions correspond to peaks in the graphics. For the B-pillar the biggest ICDM value is observed for node 3 which also corresponds to the biggest difference in the properties of the adjacent cross-sections. As at nodes 4 and 6 these transitions are smoother, the ICDM values are smaller too.

                            are more flexible than the corresponding CM both in terms of translations and rotations. Moreover, for the control node translations and rotations of cases 7 and 8, the concept models without flanges are even more flexible than the detailed ones. This reduced stiffness can be explained with the difference with respect to the actual cross-sectional properties of the various beam parts. On the other hand, while this effect is considerable for cases 7 and 8, it is less influential for case 9, where other error factors are predominant such as the in-plane cross-section deformations, the discontinuities and the spot welds.

                           9, thus explaining partially the big discrepancy between the concept and the detailed model of the B-pillar.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The improper modeling of the spot welds, the exclusion of the flanges as well as the high degree of cross-section complexity can all decrease the quality of the concept model, as confirmed in Section 3.2.2. Being closely related to all industrial case studies, these three factors are discussed hereafter.
                              
                                 •
                                 
                                    Beam cross-section geometry: The results from Section 3.1 clearly demonstrated that GNCS and STCS are inappropriate except for some non-realistic academic cases. When it comes to complex real structures, the ABCS approach is recommended. However, depending on the complexity of the cross-section geometry, some simplification choices must be still made. Beam-like structures like the A- or the B-pillar are often made by more than two stamped metal sheets and can also have internal stiffeners (Fig. 3(a)). Including all the details in the concept model could be unnecessary, it could require too much modeling efforts or it could be even impossible due to technical limitations of the existing tools (e.g. not more than one internal layer allowed [24]). The ABCS in the concept model must be the right compromise between simplification and accuracy. A rule-of-thumb was defined to decrease the number of adjacent internal layers without changing the mass. It was successfully applied during the creation of both the A- and the B-pillar concept models.


                                    Spot welds: By closing the gaps between the flanges, the detailed models result stiffer (Tables 12 and 13). As such an approach is also applied during the creation of the concept models, it contributes to their increased stiffness with respect to the reference structures. As in a detailed FE model of the BIW there are thousands of spot weld connections, this becomes an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there are no alternative methods to use during the model creation phase. An approach based on model updating/correction coefficients could be subsequently applied. In such an adjustment process, the modeling errors are corrected but on their turn they are due to the mixed influence of all factors. The prediction capabilities of such forcibly changed concept model are therefore not guaranteed.


                                    Flanges: Not considering the flanges in the concept model leads to significant discrepancies in the stiffness with respect to the reference structure. The concept models are typically less stiff than their counterparts with flanges, and in some cases also than the detailed ones (Tables 12 and 13). Moreover, considerable errors are introduced regarding the mass and the principal moments of inertia of the beam structures (Table 11). Having different mass consequently deteriorates the concept model accuracy for dynamic load cases. Finally, it is not advisable to remove the flanges in the concept model not only because of the resultant erroneous static and dynamic behavior but also because of the geometrical differences that arise. ABCS are the most appropriate choice to model the flanges. However, during optimization the entire cross-section is rescaled which is undesirable. In this regard, proper methodologies for 1D beam optimization handling must be developed, that take into account the flanges but do not resize them.

In this section two industrial cases are considered and the previously derived guidelines are employed. Firstly, the quality of an existing BIW concept model is assessed. Secondly, the established good practices for concept modeling are applied in order to create a hybrid detailed-concept FE model of a BIW.

The concept FE model of the BMW 3 series BIW is shown in Fig. 20
                         (detailed 1D element display). The model has 13137 nodes (13675 elements). 1D beams with ABCS are used to represent the reference structure. In total, there are 319 different ABCS, out of which 115 are open cross-sections and the remaining ones are closed. Such a concept FE model is small-sized and parametric. As ABCS are used instead of STCS, the model is not only as close as possible to the real geometry, but also more accurate.

The global static performance of the vehicle BIW was evaluated on the base of a bending (K
                        
                           b
                        ) and torsion (K
                        
                           t
                        ) load case (Figs. 21 and 22
                        
                        , simple 1D element display). It was thus possible to obtain the following components of the internal forces and moments in each 1D beam element: bending moments in the two reference planes at the neutral axis, shear forces in the two reference planes at the shear center, axial force at the neutral axis, total torque about the beam shear center axis and component of this torque due to warping. Because of the confirmed influence of torsion generated in 1D beams on the model accuracy (Section 3.1.2), the total and warping torques are discussed hereafter.

As there was a considerable number of open cross-sections in this concept model, the warping DOF was activated for all 1D beams in order to approximate the effect of out-of-plane cross-section distortion. Fig. 23
                        (a) and (b) shows the total and warping torque respectively both at end A for all 1D beam elements. These color plots were obtained from the K
                        
                           b
                         load case. Similarly, Fig. 24
                        (a) and (b) represent the total and warping torques resulting from the K
                        
                           t
                         load case.

As discussed in Section 3.1.2, the error is expected to be bigger for the 1D beam structures subject to torsion which are open or have discontinuities. Moreover, the bigger the generated torque, the bigger will be the in-plane cross-section deformations unaccounted for and the error. As it can be seen from Figs. 23(a) and 24(a) the torques with the highest absolute values are concentrated in a relatively small part of the structure. For the K
                        
                           b
                         load case this is mainly the door-sill and for the K
                        
                           t
                         load case—the rear part of the vehicle. However, all 1D beam cross-sections corresponding to these parts are closed. Thus, the reasonable assumption can be made that a low modeling error can be expected relative to the in-plane cross-section distortion. Regarding the warping torque, its highest absolute values are concentrated in an even smaller part of the structure (Figs. 23(b) and 24(b)). These parts are mainly related to structural joints, e.g. the base of the B-pillar. They represent complex structures with both open and closed cross-sections [3]. This makes the warping activation mandatory. A similar analysis can be made for any other concept model of the vehicle structure. As a result, either its adequacy can be confirmed (as in this case study), or better insight can be given for the causes of the modeling errors.

The Toyota Rav4 BIW shown in Fig. 25
                         was used as reference FE model. The front and rear windshields were also taken into consideration although they are not part of the BIW as they strongly influence the car stiffness. The model has 249640 nodes (253406 elements).

To study the modeling error due to the use of 1D beams at global scale, a hybrid FE model of the BIW was created. For this purpose, several beam-like parts of the body were substituted with ABCS concept beams—A-, B-, C-pillar, windscreen header rail and side roof rail (Fig. 26
                        ). Consequently, the resulting hybrid model (Fig. 27
                        ) was in parts detailed and in parts concept.

During the creation of the hybrid FE model incompatible elements had to be connected—1D beam to 2D shell elements. Where relevant, the connections between the shell elements belonging to the panel-like parts (e.g. windshield, roof) and the 1D beam parts were created following the original spot weld layout of the reference FE model (shell to shell connections). In addition, each of the 1D beam structures was connected at its both ends to the adjacent shell elements of the detailed FE model through rigids (Nastran RBE2 elements [24]). Although such a solution introduces some additional stiffness in the model [6], it is among the popular and recommended approaches because of its simplicity [2,12,29,30]. To assess the stiffening effect of the rigid beam to shell connections a stiffened detailed model was created. The only difference with respect to the reference model (Fig. 25) is that the stiffened one had also rigid elements connecting the same nodes as in the hybrid model. The stiffened BIW is shown in transparent view in Fig. 28
                        , where all rigid connections are evidenced in red.

To evaluate the global static performance of the reference, hybrid and stiffened BIW two load cases were used for bending and torsion respectively. They were defined according to the static test benches most often used in the industry [31] and are similar to the ones used for the BMW concept model (Figs. 21 and 22). A detailed description of the two load cases is given in [12,32]. For the evaluation of the global dynamic performance modal analysis was performed for the three BIW models under free–free conditions. The first 6 eigenmodes were considered.

                         are zero for the mass. In the first case this is due to the fact that the rigid elements added in BIW
                        
                           rgd
                         have no mass. As for the second case, the concept beams in the hybrid model were created as accurately as possible from geometrical point of view, following all the guidelines derived in Sections 3.1.3 and 3.2.3. ABCS beams were used and all flanges were considered. Where relevant, equivalent layers were created according to the defined rule-of-thumb (Eq. (6)).

On the other hand, BIW
                        
                           rgd
                         results in overestimation with an average of 9.2 % for the static stiffness and with an average of 6.3% for the eigenfrequencies. Although the stiffening effect of using rigid connections was expected, these errors resulted too high, given that just part of the structure was considered. The connection between dissimilar elements is thus an important error factor for hybrid models, which has to be studied in detail and treated properly. Various attempts have been made to resolve the problem [4,6,10,33], but still no established solution exists. Alternatively, there are concept models in which the complex joint structure is simplified, e.g. rotational springs [34], junction of 1D beams [3,7–9] and similar. Despite the absence of incompatible elements in these cases, other problems have to be confronted such as the model accuracy, the relation with the actual joint structure, and the method's validity and applicability for any vehicle joint.

The errors regarding the static and dynamic performance of BIW
                        
                           hyb
                         are even bigger. The average overestimation is 14.3% for the static stiffness and 9.4% for the eigenfrequencies. These errors have three main sources: the cross-section distortion, the spot welds and the rigid beam to shell connections. The used beam theory has a direct impact on the model accuracy, as in-plane cross-section deformations are not considered and each beam structure could result stiffer. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of advanced beam theories which can successfully face the challenges posed by the typical automotive industry problems. In accordance with the conclusions made in Section 3.2.3, closing the cross-sections of the 1D beams to represent the spot welds results in further increase of the model stiffness. However, there are no alternative approaches acting during the model creation. Only the disadvantageous model updating or correction coefficients can be applied. On the other hand, both these factors taken together (spot welds and local deformations) result generally less influential than the third one. As confirmed by the results for BIW
                        
                           rgd
                        , the biggest portion of the error in the hybrid model can be attributed to the rigid element connections. However, BIW
                        
                           hyb
                         shows a deterioration of the MAC for the torsional mode shape which, compared to BIW
                        
                           rgd
                        , is higher than the corresponding variation of the eigenfrequency. This behavior can be ascribed to the introduction of 1D beams. Thus the in-depth analysis of the 3D–1D element connection and the investigation of the dynamic behavior of 1D beams turn out to be promising fields of research.

@&#CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK@&#

This paper deals with the main factors that can cause errors in 1D beam concept models: the beam cross-section geometry, the incorrect approximation of spot welds and flanges, the presence of discontinuities and the lack of local cross-section deformations. As demonstrated on a set of idealized and non-idealized case-studies, these factors can generate significant discrepancies with respect to the detailed FE model in terms of geometrical similarity and structural behavior. Their better understanding is mandatory both for creating better concept models, and for assessing the performance of the existing ones. In this regard, the guidelines derived from the current study have been successfully applied for the qualitative analysis of a BIW concept model and for the quantitative analysis of a BIW hybrid model.

The future work will be focused on an integral approach for 1D beam modeling and optimization handling that guarantees the accuracy of the concept model. Efforts will be dedicated to improve the connection between dissimilar elements, as well as to the development of an advanced cross-section deformation criterion. Finally, the behavior of 1D beam composite structures should be investigated, because of the increased problem complexity and relevance to the automotive industry.
