                  The objective of the paper is to investigate the applicability of a model order reduction technique for dynamic simulation of beams with forcing and geometric nonlinearities. A cantilever and a doubly clamped beams actuated by an electrostatic force are considered in the paper. The governing partial differential equations for the two cases which account for the nonlinearities are presented. These equations are spatially discretized using the Galerkin finite element method (FEM). The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is reduced using the trajectory piecewise linear model order reduction (TPWLMOR) method. Simulation indicates that the use of the original TPWLMOR method leads to the presence of a phase error in the long term dynamic simulation of the models. To improve the accuracy of the dynamic response, a modification to the original TPWLMOR based on minimization of residual at linearization point is proposed. Further, the parameters affecting the accuracy of the modified TPWLMOR are studied.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Most practical engineering problems such as very large scale integration (VLSI) circuits, vibration and acoustic systems, molecular dynamics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are complex in nature, involving coupled physical domains and nonlinearities. Such complex structures are usually modeled with the help of partial differential equations (PDE). A spatial discretization of the PDE yields a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). The dimension of the ODE depends on the discretization, that is, the spatial mesh size. The smaller the mesh size, the larger the number of ODEs to be solved, resulting in large scale systems. However, the simulation of large scale systems requires high computational time and memory storage. Therefore many analysis and design problems cannot be solved within a reasonable amount of computing time. In order to mitigate this problem, model order reduction (MOR) techniques are gaining a lot of attention.

The main objective of model order reduction is to reduce the computational cost of the solution by constructing low dimensional approximations which do not lead to significant loss in accuracy and yet, preserve the essential properties of the original model [1]. From the point of view of structural dynamics, model order reduction deals with the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom (Dofs) of the dynamical system. Generally, projection based model order reduction methods project the equations of motion from a high dimensional space of dimension N onto a smaller dimensional subspace of dimension q, by applying the transformation

                        V
                      define the bases of the lower dimensional space. Based on the choice of 
                        V
                     , different model order reduction methods are available.

Model reduction of linear large scale systems is a very well developed area [1]. In linear structural dynamical systems, modal vectors (eigenmodes) are often used as basis vectors (columns of 
                        V
                     ) and the method is prominently known as mode superposition [2,3]. Static condensation techniques based on Guyan reduction [4] are also popular in structural dynamics. Another commonly used method is the component mode synthesis (CMS), introduced by Hurty [5] and simplified by Craig and Bampton [6]. It is based on a combination of static condensation and mode superposition. Recently, moment matching methods, also known as Krylov subspace techniques [7–9] have also become more popular.

As nonlinear systems do not obey the principle of superposition, the model order reduction of these systems require different techniques. To obtain a reduced model of nonlinear systems, it is necessary to reduce the complexity of the nonlinear function. This can be achieved by approximating the nonlinear function by a simpler form. Depending upon the approximation, there are different methods for model order reduction of nonlinear systems. Nickell [10] used a local mode superposition method to solve the nonlinear structural dynamics problem. In this approach, the system is linearized at every time instant and modal bases corresponding to the solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem are used to reduce the model order. However, repeated solutions of eigenvalue make this approach computationally costly. Bathe and Gracewski [11] and Clough and Wilson [12] used substructuring and CMS methods for weakly nonlinear problems where the nonlinearity existed in some localized region. Krishna and Padmanabhan [13] discussed mode superposition and substructuring method with harmonic balance method and time variational method to improve reduced order solution techniques for localized nonlinear systems. Noor [14] employed path derivatives obtained by successive differentiation of governing equations to generate bases for model reduction of nonlinear problems. Idelsohn and Cardona [15,16] proposed the method of modal derivatives to generate the basis for reducing the model order of nonlinear structural dynamics problems. The most commonly used method for general nonlinear systems is the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), originated by Kosambi [17]. It is also known as Principal Component Analysis and the Karhunen–Love Decomposition. Lumley [18] introduced these ideas in the fluid dynamics of turbulent flows. The application of this procedure can also be found in the field of structural dynamics. This method can be used for any complex linear as well as nonlinear system. However, to obtain proper orthogonal bases it requires a-priori simulation of the full-scale systems. Lin et al. [19] used POD bases to obtain the reduced order model of nonlinear dynamics of MEMS actuator. Binion and Chen [20] proposed a Krylov enhanced POD method for accurately modeling of input/ouput behaviour of nonlinear systems.

Linear model order reduction methods can also be used for model reduction of nonlinear systems after applying linearization or Taylor series expansion (Quadratic expansion) [21,22] of system nonlinearity or by Volterra series of nonlinearity (bilinearization) [23,24], followed by suitable projection. Such methods are simple, inexpensive but valid only for a limited range of the given inputs. The idea of linearization leads to a method proposed by Rewienski and White [25] where a nonlinear system is represented by a weighted combination of linear models generated along the trajectory at different linearization points.

The present work is concerned with the application of the TPWLMOR method for model order reduction of electrostatically actuated nonlinear beams. Such beams find application in MEMS devices. Various approaches have been proposed in the literature which deals with model order reduction of nonlinear dynamics of MEMS devices. Younis et al. [26] used normal modes to represent the nonlinear dynamics behaviour of an electrically actuated microbeam. Nayfeh eta al. [27] applied two different methods for model reduction of MEMS, viz. reduction of nodes of the discretized system and reduction of domains. Hung and Senturia [28] generated a reduced order model by extracting global basis functions using singular value decomposition (SVD), by using data from a few runs of fully meshed finite-element simulations. Chen et al. [29] presented a technique by combining Taylor series expansion and Arnoldi method to automatically develop a reduced order model. Rewienski and White [30] used TPWL method to solve the MEMS micro-switch problem where nonlinearities due to electrostatic and fluidic forces were considered. They modeled the dynamic behaviour of the coupled electro-mechanical-fluid system using 1D Euler beam equation and 2D Reynold's squeeze film damping equation with Finite Difference Method (FDM). However, the model does not account for mid-plane stretching. Ouakad and Younis [31] observed significant difference in the dynamic response with midplane stretching compared with that predicted without midplane stretching. Note that the longitudinal inertia term is neglected in the dynamic simulation of doubly clamped MEMS actuators [32]. In the present study, the inertia term is considered to maintain the generality of the equations arising from the finite element discretization.

The main contribution of the present paper is the investigation of the applicability of the TPWLMOR method to perform model reduction of a system of nonlinear equations arising from the application of the Galerkin based finite element method to a nonlinear structural dynamic problems. Further, a method is proposed for selecting the linearization points based on the minimization of residual to improve the accuracy of the solution. The problems considered are electro-statically actuated micro-cantilever and doubly clamped beams (see Section 2). These can be thought of representative problems in structural dynamics demonstrating forcing nonlinearity and combined forcing and geometric nonlinearities (midplane stretching). The constructions of the reduced order models using the TPWLMOR method and modified TPWLMOR method are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, three time integration schemes viz. Hilber–Hughes–Taylor (HHT) method [33], Newmark method [34] and Bathe method [35–37] which are used with the modified TPWLMOR method are briefly explained. Results obtained using both the reduced models and the investigations of the parameters affecting the accuracy of this method are presented in Section 5. Concluding remarks follow in Section 6.

This section describes the equations governing the dynamic behaviour of an electro-statically actuated micro-cantilever beam and doubly clamped microbeam. Figs. 1 and 2
                     
                      show schematics of an electro-statistically actuated micro-cantilever beam and doubly clamped microbeam, respectively. The microbeam (movable electrode) having length

                        )
                      and cross-sectional area 
                        (
                        A

                      is in a capacitive arrangement with the fixed electrode plate with an initial gap g
                     0. Both bodies are perfect conductors and are separated by an electric medium of permittivity 
                        ϵ
                     . A positive potential difference (V) between the two conductors causes deflection of the microbeam. Damping is neglected for both the cases.

In this case, a movable electrode is modeled using the linear Euler–Bernoulli beam theory since for a typical microbeam

The schematic diagram of an electro-statistically actuated doubly clamped microbeam is shown in Fig. 2. A movable electrode is modeled using nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory which accommodates the midplane stretching nonlinearities present in the beam due to fixed boundaries. Effects of transverse shear stresses are neglected since for a typical microbeam

The system of nonlinear ODEs obtained in Section 2 (see Eqs. (13) and (26)) is of order N where N is the total number of degrees of freedom. The solution of such nonlinear ODEs is performed using an incremental approach [2]. Direct time integration methods are typically used to solve incremental equations. To get the complete response of the nonlinear system, incremental equilibrium equations are formed at each time step and then these equations are solved using equilibrium iterations. The time consuming part in an incremental analysis lies in the calculation of the tangent stiffness matrices and the equilibrium iterations at each time step. Therefore the solution of nonlinear ODEs is computationally inefficient. In order to reduce the problem size and computational efforts, reduced order models are generated and are discussed in the present section.

Trajectory Piecewise Linear method is a projection based model order reduction method, developed by Rewienski and White [25,30], based on the Krylov subspace technique. The central idea in the TPWLMOR is to represent a nonlinear dynamical system as a weighted combination of linear models which are generated by linearizing the original nonlinear system at different states (known as linearization points) [25]. For each linearized model, Krylov subspace method is applied to construct the reduced order model. This method has found applications in electrical circuits, fluid dynamics and heat transfer fields. Dong and Roychowdhury [43], Tiwary and Rutenbar [44], Martinez [45] have used this method for model order reduction of nonlinear dynamics simulation of electrical circuits. Yang and Shen [46] have applied this method for the nonlinear heat transfer of MEMS model. Gratton [47] applied this method to computational fluid dynamics to solve nonlinear flow control problems.

The main steps of the original TPWL algorithm, when applied to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (e.g. see equation (26)) arising in the context of finite element model to solve a geometric and electrostatic nonlinear dynamics problem, are described next.

                        The orthogonal bases in the Krylov subspace (see Eq. (32)) are generated using the Arnoldi algorithm [1,8,48] which ensures that m moments of the transfer function of reduce order linearized model match with m moments of the transfer function of the full linearized model. The computation of inverse of the matrices in the Arnoldi algorithm is avoided using LU decomposition method. The Arnoldi algorithm with LU decomposition is given in Appendix A. Using Eq. (31) and then premultiplying by

(iv) Construction of aggregate bases: At each linearization point different projection bases are generated. These projection bases span different subspaces. As a result it is required to select the set of bases which form the aggregate bases to construct a composite solution. Aggregate bases are selected using singular value decomposition (SVD). To perform SVD, a matrix 
                           X
                         is constructed such that the columns of matrix 
                           X
                         are the Krylov bases generated at the different linearization points. After performing the SVD on matrix 
                           X
                        , the orthogonal bases corresponding to the largest singular values are selected as aggregate bases 
                           (
                           q
                           )
                         to form projection matrix (
                           Φ
                        ). Here, 
                           Φ
                           ∈

It is observed that the original TPWLMOR method shows a phase error in every cycle due to piecewise linearization of a nonlinear trajectory (see Figs. 8 and 9). This phase error accumulates and after a few cycles a significant phase error is seen. To minimize this phase error, a new method for selection of linearization points is proposed. It consists of minimizing the residual at linearization points. Note that the linearization points in the original TPWLMOR do not satisfy the governing nonlinear equation of motion. It is expected that by ensuring that the linearization points satisfy the nonlinear equation of motion, the solution constructed by using these points would be more accurate as compared to the original TPWLMOR method. The residual (

                        ) at the linearization point is given by

                        where U is the linearization point. Selection of linearization point based on modified method is discussed next.

Similar to the original TPWLMOR method, the linear reduced order dynamical system (Eq. (33)) is simulated using the chosen time integration method while the current state 
                           (
                           U
                           )
                         is in the vicinity of any of the previously generated linearized points 
                           (
                           
                              
                                 U
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                           )
                        , 
                           k
                           =
                           1
                           ,
                           2
                           …
                        . This is checked by using Eq. (34). If the current state 
                           (
                           U
                           )
                         does not lie in the neighbourhood of any of the previously generated linearization points 
                           (
                           
                              
                                 U
                              
                              
                                 k
                              
                           
                           )
                         then the current state is set as the tentative new linearization point. Now at this linearization point a residual is calculated by using Eq. (38). This residual is minimized using the Newton–Raphson method [42] with the tentative linearization point as the initial guess to get the correct state. Next the nonlinear system is linearized at this corrected linearized point. The computational procedure for the proposed method for selection of linearization points is given in Algorithm 3.

The numerical solution of the second order differential equations obtained in the full nonlinear finite element model and the reduced order models is performed using the Hilber Hughes Taylor (HHT) [33] time integration scheme. Further, to study the effect of time integration schemes on the accuracy of the modified TPWLMOR method, two additional time integration schemes, namely the Newmark method [34] and the Bathe [35] method, are also implemented. The time integration schemes used in the paper are briefly described next.

The HHT method is a predictor–corrector based implicit method that provides second order accuracy and high frequency damping. Depending upon the value of input parameters, this method can be unconditionally stable. The important steps in implementation of the HHT algorithm are given in [33]. The input parameters (

                           =

                           β

                         and 
                           γ
                           =
                           0.8
                        ) are selected for simulations with HHT method.

The Newmark method is also a predictor–corrector based method. It can be considered as a special case of the HHT method with 
                           α
                           =
                           0
                        . The main steps are discussed in [34,41]. The simulations are carried out with time integration parameters, 
                           β
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           4
                         and 
                           γ
                           =
                           1
                           /
                           2
                        , which corresponds to an implicit scheme.

The Bathe method [35–37] is a composite scheme, which uses the trapezoidal rule and the 3-point backward difference method for time integration. It is an implicit method and for linear problems, it is shown to be unconditionally stable and a second order accurate method. Unlike

                         of the HHT method, this method has no parameter to adjust or set. Artificial high frequency response is damped out. This method, which gives good accuracy, is described in [35–37]. However the computational effort is more, as it requires the application of iterative methods twice, to reach a solution. Note that as linearized equations are solved in the TPWLMOR method, there is not much additional computational effort required, compared to the HHT and Newmark schemes.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

In this section, numerical validation of the reduced order models is carried out. The transient analysis of the micro-cantilever and the doubly clamped microbeam under electrostatic actuation is performed. In the case of the micro-cantilever beam and the doubly clamped microbeam, reduced order models are generated using the original TPWLMOR method and the modified TPWLMOR method. The results are compared with the full nonlinear finite element model and the published literature in terms of accuracy.

                           5
                         is used to check the convergence of the Newton–Ralphson iterations which are carried in the full method and the modified TPWLMOR.

In order to verify the full finite element model, the dynamic response of a micro-cantilever beam is compared with the results obtained by Li et al. [40]. The fringing field model used in the reference and in this work is described in Section 2.1. The analysis is performed for an applied DC step voltage of 1V and the dynamic response at the tip of microbeam is compared in Fig. 3
                        . The response of the full finite element model shows a close agreement with the results presented by Li et al. [40].

The two reduced order methods viz. the original TPWLMOR and modified TPWLMOR methods are used to generate the reduced order models of the micro-cantilever beam. The reduced order models are developed using 50 linearization points (s=50) and aggregated bases of order 8 (q=8) from the full nonlinear finite element model. The numerical solution is then obtained using the HHT method. The peak deflection, which occurs at the tip of a micro-cantilever beam under applied voltages of 1V, 1.5V, 2V and 2.1V, is shown in Fig. 4
                        . The results obtained from the original TPWLMOR model and modified TPWLMOR model are in good agreement with the full nonlinear finite element model.

Further, pull-in parameters are extracted from the original TPWLMOR and the modified TPWLMOR methods and compared with the full nonlinear finite element model and the published literature [40]. The DC voltage at which the dynamic solution diverges is noted as the pull-in voltage. The pull-in voltage obtained from reduced method is 2.14V with 0.5% error when compared with Li et al. [40]. Near the pull-in voltage, small deviation in the dynamic response of reduced models as compared to the full nonlinear model is also observed.

The dynamic analysis of a doubly clamped microbeam as shown in Fig. 2 is performed using the full finite element model and reduced models. The beam dimensions and material properties are identical to a micro-cantilever beam in Section 5.1. A beam is discretized into 50 beam elements with 3 degrees of freedom (two translational and one rotational) at each node. The analysis is performed using the HHT scheme with a time step of 
                           0.01
                           
                           μ
                           s
                        . In this analysis, fringing field effects are not considered. A full nonlinear finite element code is written based on formulation discussed in Section 2.2. The full nonlinear finite element model is first validated by comparing the dynamic response with the results obtained by De and Aluru [49]. Fig. 5
                         shows the mid-point displacement of the full nonlinear finite element model of a doubly clamped microbeam for an applied DC step voltage of 2V. The results show good agreement.

Next, the reduced order models obtained from the original TPWLMOR and modified TPWLMOR methods are compared with the full nonlinear finite element model at different pull-in voltages. Both the reduced models are generated using 45 linearization points 
                           (
                           s
                           =
                           45
                           )
                         and aggregated bases of order 10 
                           (
                           q
                           =
                           10
                           )
                         from the full nonlinear finite element model. Time integration is carried out using the HHT method. The mid-point displacements obtained at applied voltages of 8V, 12V, and 15.7V are shown for the full nonlinear FE model, original TPWLMOR model and modified TPWLMOR model in Fig. 6
                        . The results estimated from the original TPWLMOR model and modified TPWLMOR model are in good agreement with the full nonlinear FE model. The dynamic pull-in voltage is calculated as 15.8V with the full nonlinear finite element model while it is 15.9V using both the reduced order models. The error in the pull-in voltage value estimated by the reduced order models when compared with the pull-in values obtained by De and Aluru [49] is about 1.2%. Similar to the micro-cantilever beam, the dynamic response near the pull-in voltage in a doubly clamped microbeam with original TPWLMOR model and modified TPWLMOR model shows small deviation compared to the full nonlinear finite element model. Next, the time histories obtained with the full finite element model, original TPWLMOR and modified TPWLMOR methods are compared.

In this section the original TPWLMOR and modified TPWLMOR methods are compared based on accuracy of long term nonlinear dynamics response. The reduced order models with original TPWLMOR and modified TPWLMOR methods are generated using 75 and 135 linearization points and keeping the order of model as 10 for an applied DC voltage of 15V. The dynamic response is simulated using these reduced models for more than 100 cycles and solution is compared with the full finite element model. Figs. 7 and 8
                        
                         shows the mid-point displacement of reduced order models and the full nonlinear finite element model between

                         is the transverse displacement computed from the reduced models. The percentage relative error between the reduced order models and full nonlinear finite element model is shown in Fig. 9
                        .

It is observed that with the modified TPWLMOR model percentage relative error is less when compared with the original TPWLMOR model.

From the results presented in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 it can be seen that the original TPWLMOR and the modified TPWLMOR methods can be used to estimate the short term dynamic response and the long term dynamic response, respectively, of the nonlinear beams. It is observed that the dynamic response estimated from the reduced order models shows small variation in the results compared to the full nonlinear FE model near pull-in voltage. This is due to two sources of error in the dynamic response: error due to linearization and error due to transformation of the full linearized model into reduced space. These sources of error are studied next in the context of the doubly clamped microbeam.

To study the effect of the number of linearization points on the accuracy of dynamic response of the doubly clamped microbeam, three reduced order models (with modified TPWLMOR method) using 30, 40 and 50 linearization points are developed, from the full nonlinear finite element model for an applied voltage of 15V. Fig. 10
                            shows the comparison of the dynamic response of the full nonlinear finite element model and the three reduced order models.

The results of the reduced models and the full finite element model are compared using percentage relative difference (see Eq. (39), Fig. 11
                           ). It is observed that at any fixed time instant as the number of linearization points increases the relative error decreases. The periodic nature of the error can be attributed to the periodic nature of the response. The oscillating behaviour of the relative error is observed. The zero value corresponds to the point where the response curves of the full nonlinear FE model and the modified TPWLMOR model are identical. It is noticed that the relative error decreases with the number of linearization points. However it increases with time for the selected number of linearization points mainly due to the phase error. This phase error can be minimized by increasing the number of linearization points (refer Fig. 8). The distribution of linearization points generated by the modified TPWLMOR for the dynamic response of the doubly clamped microbeam is also shown in Fig. 12
                           . As the response of the beam is periodic, one observes higher number of linearization points in the initial part of the dynamic response.

To study the effect of the number of aggregate bases on the accuracy of the dynamic response of the doubly clamped microbeam, four reduced order models (with modified TPWLMOR) are generated by keeping same number of linearization points 
                              (
                              s
                              =
                              40
                              )
                            and different number of aggregate bases (q=6, q=8, q=10 and q=12) for an applied voltage of 15V. Fig. 13
                            shows the mid point displacement of the three reduced order models and the full nonlinear finite element model. The percentage relative error is also computed and is shown in Fig. 14
                           .


                           Fig. 14 shows that up to q=10, the accuracy of the modified TPWLMOR model increases with increase in the number of aggregate bases. The reduced order model with q=12 shows the same relative error value as that of model with q=10. Thus it can be seen that there is no further reduction of error with addition of aggregate bases.

It can also be observed from the results that the essential dynamics of a microbeam can be accurately captured by restricting oneself to a minimum number of aggregate bases (in this problem q=10). Further addition of aggregate bases does not reduce the error in modified TPWLMOR model. The residual error is due to the linearization of the original nonlinear equations and can only be reduced by increasing the number of linearization points.

                            compares the dynamic response of the modified TPWLMOR model using the different time integration schemes with the full nonlinear finite element model. The percentage relative error is also computed between the full nonlinear FE model and the modified TPWLMOR model, and is shown in Fig. 16
                           . It is observed that up to 
                              10

                            all the three method yields percentage relative error less than 3%. However, the HHT and Bathe time integration schemes are more accurate than the Newmark scheme.

Thus, for the same time step 
                              Δ
                              t
                           , the modified TPWLMOR coupled with either the HHT or the Bathe method is observed to be more accurate than when it is coupled with the Newmark method.

In this subsection the comparison of the performance of the original TPWLMOR method and modified TPWLMOR with the full nonlinear finite element model is presented. The performance is measured in terms of the computational time. The simulations are carried out in

                        . The computational time in case of the reduced model includes the time for generation of the reduced model and the time required for its integration. The computational time in the case of the original TPWLMOR and modified TPWLMOR method depends on the number of linearization points and the size of aggregate bases selected for model reduction.

The original TPWLMOR model is about 40 times faster than the full nonlinear finite element model while modified TPWLMOR model is about 9 times faster than the full nonlinear finite element model with percentage relative error less than 2% for 1000 degrees of freedom. This difference is due to the fact that a minimization of a system nonlinear equations is carried out at each linearization time. It is also observed that as the number of linearization points increases, the computational time increases, and at the same time accuracy of modified TPWLMOR model increases (see Fig. 19
                        ).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In the present work the dynamic response of nonlinear electro-statically actuated beams is simulated using a reduced order method. Two beams showing distinct nonlinearities, viz. a cantilever (forcing nonlinearity) and a doubly clamped beam (forcing and geometric nonlinearities) are considered. The dynamic response and the dynamic pull-in parameters are computed using the TPWLMOR method and are in good agreement with the published data for both the actuators. It is observed that the accuracy of the original TPWLMOR method decreases for long term dynamic response. A phase error, which leads to the temporal shift in the solution of the reduced model with respect to the full solution, is observed. To decrease this phase error a modified TPWLMOR method based on the minimization of the residual at the linearization point is proposed. The accuracy of the modified TPWLMOR method is studied with respect to the number of linearization points, size of aggregate bases and different time integration schemes. It is observed that the phase error decreases as the number of linearization points increases. These observations lead to the conclusion that the phase error is primarily present due to the linearization of the nonlinear equations and will always be present in the current formulation of the reduced order method. The accuracy obtained by the modified TPWLMOR method is found to increase with the number of aggregate bases. The accuracy is also observed to increase with the decrease of time step, as expected. Different second order accurate time integration schemes such as the HHT method, Newmark method and Bathe method affect the accuracy of modified TPWLMOR with the HHT method being the most accurate method for this particular application. The computational performance of the original TPWLMOR method and modified TPWLMOR method is studied in comparison to the full nonlinear finite element model. The original TPWLMOR method is observed to be very efficient as compared to the full nonlinear finite element model, with admissible inaccuracy. This advantage is significantly more for the problem with both geometric and electrostatic nonlinearities (up to 40 times faster) as compared to the problem with only forcing nonlinearity (up to 20 times faster). The primary cause of this enhanced performance is the elimination of the equilibrium calculations which are required to be carried out in the full nonlinear finite element model. Compared to the original TPWLMOR method, the modified TPWLMOR method is computationally slow but more efficient than the full nonlinear finite element model. The reduction in the computational performance of the modified method as compared to the original method is due to the equilibrium calculations at linearization points. The study revealed that the original TPWLMOR model captures the short term dynamic response of both the microbeams accurately and efficiently while the modified TPWLMOR method captures both the short term and long term response accurately and efficiently.

Based on the investigations it is seen that the TPWLMOR can be effectively coupled with the conventional finite element method to achieve substantial reduction in computational effort. This coupling does not involve any major additional effort as all the tools (tangent stiffness matrices, linearized equations of motion, time integration schemes) required by the TPWLMOR are readily available within the framework of the standard finite element method. Further development of the coupling of the TPWLMOR and the conventional finite element method is a part of ongoing work.
