                  A nonlinear beam formulation is developed that is suitable to describe adhesion and debonding of thin films. The formulation is based on a shear-flexible, geometrically exact beam theory that allows for large beam deformations. The theory incorporates several aspects that have not been considered in previous theories before. Two different adhesion mechanisms are considered here: adhesion by body forces and adhesion by surface tractions. Corresponding examples are van der Waals adhesion and cohesive zone models. Both mechanisms induce a bending moment within the beam that can play an important role in adhesion and debonding of thin films. The new beam model is discretized within a nonlinear finite element formulation. It is shown that the new formulation leads to a symmetric stiffness matrix for both adhesion mechanisms. The new formulation is used to study the peeling behavior of a gecko spatula. It is shown that the beam model is capable of capturing the main features of spatula peeling accurately, while being much more efficient than 3D solid models.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The adhesion, debonding, and peeling behavior of thin strips and films plays an important role in many applications. Examples are paints and coatings, adhesive tapes, liquid films, and adhesive pads of insects and lizards like the gecko spatula pad. Since thin strips are slender, often also elongated, structures they are natural candidates for the consideration of beam theory. This is the basis of several analytical thin film peeling models that have been formulated starting with the seminal work of Kendall [1], see for example [2–5]. Analytical models are based on simplified assumptions regarding geometry and deformation. Thus they are not suitable to describe general problems characterized by the nonlinearities of large deformations and by complex geometries, as they are found in adhesive systems of insects and lizards. In these cases computational models are indispensable.

The objective of this paper, therefore, is to formulate a computational beam model for adhesion, debonding, and peeling. Here, we focus on a 2D formulation that is suitable to describe plane strain conditions of films, or to describe 2D behavior of beams. The considered formulation is based on the nonlinear, geometrically exact beam theory of Reissner [6], of which a computational counterpart is discussed in a book by Wriggers [7]. This formulation is generalized to beams with an initially curved axis and an arbitrary shaped cross section, which may vary along the beam. This is also accounted for in the presented contact formulation. The beam model is extended by two different adhesion formulations: adhesion by body forces and adhesion by surface tractions. The first is suitable to describe van der Waals adhesion, the second is suitable to include cohesive zone models. The formulation presented here is an extension of the van der Waals-based beam adhesion formulation of Sauer [8]. The new formulation accounts for both the shear deformation of the beam and a bending moment that is caused by the adhesion forces. Both these contributions have not been incorporated into a computational beam model before. It is seen that, combined, the two contributions lead to a symmetric finite element stiffness matrix. The symmetry is lost if one of the contributions is neglected. This symmetry reflects the fact that the model can be derived from a potential. The computational model presented here has been applied by Sauer [9] for studying the peeling behavior of shear-rigid beams with a rectangular cross section. The purpose of that study was to investigate the material and adhesion properties of thin peeling films, and to show that the bending stiffness can play a major role during peeling. It did, however, neither discuss the computational modeling nor the extension to shear-flexible beams with arbitrary, varying cross sections. This is the purpose of the present work.

The major advantage of the new formulation is the huge gain in efficiency it offers compared to adhesion models for 3D solids, like the model of Sauer and Wriggers [10]. To illustrate this, we compare the new beam formulation with the detailed 3D spatula model of Sauer and Holl [11], considering a vibration analysis and several peeling cases. It is seen that the beam model is capable of capturing the behavior of the spatula accurately. For the study, the characteristic beam properties (centroid, cross section, second moment of area, etc.) need to be determined from the detailed 3D geometry, which is discussed in detail. Since a van der Waals-based adhesion model leads to a purely normal (i.e. mode I) contact formulation, we also study gecko adhesion by considering a cohesive zone formulation that can describe tangential (mode II) debonding. In summary, it is shown that the new formulation is (1) more accurate than previous beam formulations, (2) consistent with continuum theory, and (3) a highly efficient alternative to 3D solid models.

The remaining sections of this paper are structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the geometrically exact beam theory and shows how various adhesion formulations are adapted to the beam. Section 3 then presents the corresponding finite element formulation for adhesive beams. Numerical examples are discussed in Section 4. These consider the peeling behavior of a gecko spatula for various loading conditions and compare the beam results with detailed 3D computations based on solid elements. Section 5 concludes this paper.

This section presents the model equations governing the mechanical behavior of a thin adhesive strip. We discuss two different continuum adhesion models and their adaption to beam theory, focusing first on the internal work,

In the following, we outline the kinematics and constitution of the geometrically exact beam formulation of Reissner [6], see also [7]. This formulation accounts for the exact kinematics of large beam deformations and rotations. According to the assumptions of beam theory, only normal strains, due to axial forces and bending moments, and shear strains, due to shear forces, are considered. This means that the beam is supposed to be shear-flexible (like the Timoshenko beam). Further, the cross section of the beam is supposed to remain planar (but not necessarily normal to the beam axis) during deformation. Fig. 1
                         shows the nonlinear kinematics of the deforming beam. As shown, the beam axis is described by the coordinate S in the undeformed reference configuration,

                        . The deformation of the beam is fully characterized by the three independent fields u(S), w(S), and

                           (

                        Expression (8) provides a geometrically exact definition of the beam strains w.r.t. the local coordinate system. The strain definition according to Eq. (8) is the logical extension of the infinitesimal beam kinematics to large deformations and rotations.

The local axial force, N, shear force, V, and bending moment, M, of the beam follow from the chosen constitutive model. Here, we consider linear elastic material behavior, so the cross-sectional force

This section discusses the formulation of adhesive contact, considering either bulk adhesion or adhesion by surface tractions. For both, the substrate is supposed to be much stiffer than the peeling strip, such that the deformation of the substrate can be omitted.

                           Altogether, it is seen that due to the inclination of the beam, three effects have appeared:
                              
                                 1.
                                 An increase of the adhesion force,

                                    , by the factor 
                                       1
                                       /

                                    , which has the same effect as an actual increase of the film density,

an additional bending moment,

                                    , and

a coupling between the adhesion forces and the shear deformation, γ, via the angle ψ appearing in Eq. (8). This last contribution will lead to a fully symmetric finite element tangent matrix as seen in Section 3.

                                 The cohesive zone model (36) is unstable for compression due to the absence of any stabilizing forces perpendicular to

                                    . In order to stabilize compression, a penalty regularization can be used here.

In principle, also other surface adhesion laws can be considered instead of Eq. (36).

This section discusses a simple test case in order to perform a convergence study for the FE beam model.

                        , which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. Small differences are to be expected here because the assumption of pure bending made for the analytical solution is not valid close to the peeling zone of the strip. A detailed 2D finite element analysis by Sauer [15] provides a bending moment of 
                           M
                           =

                        . This value is very close to the result obtained with the beam model. The difference between both solutions is a consequence of the different models. The 2D model differs from the beam model in the assumptions of nonlinear (Neo-Hookean) elasticity and the independence of the contact traction from the strip inclination, ψ.

The beam model discussed in the previous sections is now used to model the peeling process of a gecko spatula.

                        3
                        The spatulae form the tips of the fine hairs (setae) covering the gecko toes.
                      A detailed 3D finite element model of a single spatula is provided by Sauer and Holl [11]. On the basis of this model, we generate a reduced beam geometry that has the same cross-sectional properties as the 3D model, but requires significantly less degrees of freedoms. Besides the continuum model, we also re-examine the previous spatula beam model of Sauer [8], which considers both a simplified geometry and contact formulation. The three different models are compared by performing a vibration and peeling analysis.

In the following, we use

                           nm
                         for normalization. As shown in Fig. 5
                        , the 3D spatula geometry of Sauer and Holl [11] consists of a cylindrical shaft, which ends in a flat, triangular pad. While the pad itself is very thin, its rim is significantly thicker. The geometry is symmetric w.r.t. the (X,Y)-plane, see Fig. 5.

Although its shape is three-dimensional, we assume here that the attachment and peeling of the spatula can be described within the plane of symmetry. We thus reduce the 3D solid model to a two-dimensional beam model by defining the axis, S, within this plane as shown in Fig. 5. The cross section properties, A and I, are obtained according to the procedure outlined in Table 2
                        .

For the spatial discretization of the beam model, we follow the approach of Sauer and Holl [11] who have used a coarse finite element mesh for the spatula branch and a fine mesh for the pad. Here, elements of length

                         for the branch and approx.

                         for the pad are used. We reduce with the chosen mesh the number of degrees of freedom from approx. 420,000 to 4000, i.e. by approximately 99%.

In Fig. 6

For the sake of comparability, we also consider a Saint Venant–Kirchhoff material model here: this model shows – like our beam model – a linear stress–strain relation, but a geometrically nonlinear behavior.

In the following, we compare the vibration characteristics of the three different spatula models by performing a modal analysis. For this purpose, we clamp the spatula at the shaft boundary,

The first eigenmodes of the present beam model agree well with the results obtained with the solid model. It is seen in Fig. 7 that the nodes of vibrations occur at the same locations for both spatula models.

In this section, the peeling behavior of the three spatula models is compared by considering the van der Waals model and by studying peeling due to bending and vertical loading. In addition, we investigate peeling due to horizontal loading, using the cohesive zone formulation described in Section 2.3.2.

First, the spatula is peeled from a flat and rigid substrate by rotating the base of the spatula shaft by

                           a shows the resulting bending moment for the solid model of Sauer and Holl [11], the present beam model, and the simplified beam model of Sauer [8]. For small inclinations, the peeling behavior of the present beam model agrees well with the results of Sauer and Holl [11]. At the beginning of the peeling process, the bending moment increases rapidly for both considered models and reaches its maximum at similar shaft inclinations, see Table 5
                           . We observe that the moment drops due to a system instability when the first part of the pad (at

                           ) is peeled from the substrate. Here, the spatula cross section changes remarkably, see Fig. 6c and d. After the drop-off, the beam model produces a larger moment than the solid model. This may be caused by the axis inclination at the rim, which is not accounted for in our adhesion formulation. Regarding the solid spatula, the peeling behavior is very similar for the two considered material models. This observation confirms our assumption of large deformations but small strains.

It is important to note that the detachment behavior of the spatula beam model strongly depends on how the tip of the adhesive pad is modeled. Considering the adhesive pad surface shown in Fig. 6b, the spatula can be rotated by

In contrast to the other spatula models, the bending moment observed for the previous beam model [8] is considerably lower. After reaching

                           , the bending moment increases only slightly, see Fig. 8a. Compared with the other models, the spatula shaft has a very high bending resistance, while the bending stiffness of the pad is almost negligible (Fig. 6d). For this reason, the spatula pad accommodates most of the deformation. The observation that the bending moment is small for this model illustrates that the thicker rim of the spatula pad contributes significantly to the spatula strength.

                           , only a small part of the spatula pad adheres to the substrate. Here, the new beam model is slightly softer as the reaction force is smaller. The differences at the end of the detachment process are due to the fact that a beam theory is not applicable for the tip of the spatula pad. The solid model detaches earlier at

                           . Regarding the beam model of Sauer [8], the peeling reaction force is significantly larger, see Fig. 8b and Table 6. We can conclude that, in contrast to the previous beam model, the reduced beam model compares well with the 3D continuum model.

We now consider four different states of the peeling process, which are also marked as black diamonds in Fig. 8a and b:

                           1 is the usual normal stress for beams due to axial forces and bending. The term σ
                           2 contains the adhesive traction at the lower pad surface. Although it is not accounted for in beam theory, it can indicate the current position of the peeling front. As one can see in Fig. 10, both the spatula deformation and the internal stresses,

                           1, are very close for the two models. In addition, the peeling front occurs at the same location. This shows that the beam model is capable of capturing the peeling behavior of the spatula accurately even though it contains 90-times less degrees of freedom. Note that a more comprehensive study, discussing vertical peeling of a spatula for different pre-rotations, can be found in [11] for the 3D solid model.

                           . In this case the spatula detaches earlier from the substrate than for the original model.

The influence of the shear flexibility becomes most apparent for large spatula deformations, see e.g.

                            in Fig. 11a. Nevertheless, spatula peeling is mainly characterized by axial and bending deformation. The results show that both quantities affect the peeling behavior of the spatula. Combined together, they lead to a symmetric finite element tangent matrix, 
                              k
                           , which may accelerate the solution of the linear system (77).

                           . In the previous examples, friction had been omitted as it does not play any significant role for vertical loading [11]. For horizontal loading, however, the peeling behavior depends strongly on the friction behavior between the pad and the substrate. To model tangential debonding we consider the cohesive zone formulation discussed in Section 2.3.2. The parameters F
                           0 and g
                           0 are chosen such that, regarding the vertical direction, the cohesive zone model shows a peeling behavior similar to the van der Waals model. Here, the maximum adhesion force and the total contact energy should agree for both models. This yields

                           a. In Fig. 12b and c, the reaction force due to horizontal peeling is shown. The peeling behavior of the spatula depends strongly on the peeling direction. This is in agreement with the experimental observations of Autumn et al. [16]. Fig. 13
                            shows the deformed beam for different horizontal displacements. When the spatula is moved to the left, the adhesive spatula pad is pressed into the substrate, which causes large reaction forces, see Fig. 12b. For displacements in the positive X-direction, the pad curls up, which decreases the remaining contact area significantly. For this reason, the maximum reaction force is much smaller than for vertical peeling. Considering E=2GPa and

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This paper presents a model for thin film peeling that is based on the geometrically exact beam formulation of Reissner [6], which is essentially a nonlinear version of the Timoshenko beam accounting for finite elongation, finite bending and finite shearing of the beam. For the description of the peeling forces, two different adhesion formulations are considered: (1) Bulk adhesion, e.g. van der Waals adhesion and (2) surface adhesion, e.g. cohesive zone models. In both cases, the peeling forces induce a significant bending moment within the beam that is not considered in the previous formulation of Sauer [8]. For shear deformable beams, the bending moment is important for consistency, as the stiffness matrix becomes unsymmetric otherwise. Also, this bending moment can become quite large, as shown in [9]. The new beam formulation is validated both against analytical peeling models and existing 2D and 3D solid FE models. Compared to the latter, the new formulation allows a major reduction in the computational complexity, while remaining remarkably accurate. This is shown by several examples examining the mechanical behavior of gecko spatulae. The high efficiency of the new model is a major advantage in the context of multiscale modeling of adhesion and in the context of optimization of adhesive microstructures [17,18]. Both these applications are currently under further investigation by the authors. The current computational results are based on piecewise linear interpolation. Further accuracy gains are expected with the use of high-order, continuously differentiable interpolation such as provided by Hermite or NURBS-based interpolation. In order to study the 3D peeling behavior of adhesive strips for an arbitrary direction, the beam model can be extended by considering a three-dimensional beam formulation, e.g. [19–21].
