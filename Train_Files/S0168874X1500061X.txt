                  A mixed finite element model has been derived for the acoustic analysis of perforated dissipative silencers including several effects simultaneously: (1) High temperature and thermal gradients in the central duct and the outer absorbent material; (2) a perforated passage carrying non-uniform axial mean flow. For such a combination, the properties of sound propagation media and flow are inhomogeneous and vary with position. The material of the outer chamber can be modelled by its complex equivalent acoustic properties, which completely determine the propagation of sound waves in the air contained in the absorbent medium. Temperature gradients introduce variations in these properties that can be evaluated through a heterogeneous temperature-dependent resistivity in combination with material models obtained at room temperature. A pressure-based wave equation for stationary medium is then used with the equivalent density and speed of sound of the absorbent material varying as functions of the spatial coordinates. Regarding the central air passage, a wave equation in terms of acoustic velocity potential can be used to model the non-uniform moving medium since the presence of temperature variations introduce not only heterogeneous acoustic properties of the air but also a gradient in the mean flow velocity. The acoustic connection between the central passage and the outer chamber is given by the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. This impedance depends on the heterogeneous properties of the absorbent material and the non-uniform mean flow, leading to a spatial variation of the acoustic coupling and also to additional convective terms in the governing equations. The results presented show the influence of temperature, thermal gradients and mean flow on the transmission loss of automotive silencers. It has been found that high temperature and thermal-induced heterogeneity can have a significant influence on the acoustic attenuation of an automotive silencer and so should be included in theoretical models. In some particular configurations it may be relatively accurate to approximate the temperature field by using a uniform profile with an average value, specially for low resistivity materials. It has been shown, however, that this is not always possible and attenuation overestimation is likely to be predicted, mainly for high radial thermal gradients and high material flow resistivities, if the temperature distribution is not taken into account.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The presence of high temperature and heterogeneous properties in dissipative silencers modifies their acoustic attenuation performance. These spatial variations can arise, for example, from uneven filling processes [1–4], non-uniform mean flow fields [5] and thermal gradients [6,7]. In the latter case, the difficulties associated with experimental measurements at high temperatures make it necessary to find computational approaches useful to evaluate the acoustic behaviour of the silencer.

Several theoretical models were developed to incorporate the influence of high temperature and thermal variations in ducts. Dong and Liu [8] presented a finite element approach for rectangular ducts including flow and temperature gradient. Prasad and Crocker [9] considered a wave equation with uniform mean flow in terms of velocity potential and obtained analytically the four-pole parameters for a straight pipe in the presence of a linear temperature gradient. Munjal and Prasad [10] noted that a temperature gradient would introduce a corresponding variation in the mean density and a gradient in the mean flow velocity and Mach number, and incorporated this influence in a plane wave propagation model for a uniform pipe. Sujith [11] presented a formulation for uniform ducts with arbitrarily large temperature gradients in the absence of flow, while Dokumaci [12] and Karthik et al. [13] extended the one-dimensional approach to include the presence of mean flow.

Significant temperature variations can be found along the exhaust system of internal combustion engines [14–18]. Concerning the acoustic performance of silencers, it is straightforward to account for the effects of uniform high temperature fields if only reactive elements are present [19], since attenuation curves at different temperatures overlap when a normalized frequency f/c is considered, c being the speed of sound at working temperature T 
                     [20]. Therefore, a single computation at a known temperature allows the calculation of the acoustic attenuation performance for a wide temperature range. The previous comments cannot be applied, in general, to dissipative silencers, since the acoustic properties of the absorbent material cannot be scaled in the same way [6,7]. This indicates that the approach considered for reactive configurations cannot be used to describe sound propagation in the presence of a dissipative medium. In this case, a specific calculation is required for each temperature.

For reactive configurations, a number of works can be found where the influence of temperature and the associated gradients has been modelled and analysed. Kim et al. [21] presented a multidimensional analytical approach for the acoustic modelling of expansion chambers with mean flow and a temperature gradient. A segmentation technique was applied dividing the silencer into segments with constant temperature and mean flow, and matching the acoustic fields through the corresponding continuity conditions. The approach was extended by Kim and Choi [22] to circular reversing chambers with temperature variations and a stationary medium. Wang et al. [23] combined the segmentation procedure and the boundary element method (BEM) to compute the transmission loss of expansion chambers with uniform mean flow and a linear temperature gradient. Siano [24] presented some three-dimensional BEM results for perforated silencers with different uniform temperatures. It is worth noting that, for a continuously varying temperature field, a suitable version of the wave equation is required to account for the heterogeneous properties of the propagation medium [25,26]. For reactive configurations, this wave equation provides a model for computing the sound attenuation, once the coordinate-dependent density and speed of sound have been evaluated from the ideal gas law [7,27].

Few articles in the literature consider the effect of temperature on the performance of dissipative silencers. In principle, the equivalent bulk acoustic properties of fibres can be estimated by including the effect of temperature on the material resistivity [20]. This approach was experimentally validated by Christie [28], who predicted with reasonable agreement the characteristic impedance and propagation constant of mineral wool fibrous material at different temperatures from the combination of the flow resistivity measurements at those temperatures and a modified version of Delany and Bazley’s formulae [29,30]. Williams et al. [31] have recently provided further experimental validation at high temperatures for additional fibrous materials such as basalt wool and E glass. From an acoustical point of view, a suitable material model can be obtained by using the results obtained at room conditions while updating the material resistivity to the actual working temperature. Concerning dissipative silencers, Ref. [6] presented a mode matching–based multidimensional analytical approach to assess thermal effects on the acoustic performance of circular dissipative reversing chamber silencers. A significant temperature influence was found on the sound attenuation characteristics. To account for the temperature-induced heterogeneity within the absorbent material, a segmentation procedure was considered with a number of dissipative regions with different but axially uniform temperature. The regression formulas (similar to Delany and Bazley expressions) for texturized fibre glass at room conditions [32] were extended to high temperature applications by including the thermal influence on the material resistivity while keeping the rest of coefficients and exponents constant. The same procedure was applied in Ref. [7], where a numerical approach based on the finite element method (FEM) was presented to analyze the effect of a continuously varying temperature field on the transmission loss of perforated dissipative silencers. A suitable version of the wave equation was required to account for heterogeneous density and speed of sound [3,4,25,26]. In the previous approaches [6,7,31], the effect of the temperature on the acoustic properties of the absorbent material were accounted for by modifying the steady air-flow resistivity in the initial model of the material obtained at room temperature.

More general problems involving the simultaneous consideration of variable temperature and mean flow effects for perforated dissipative silencers containing an absorbent material require further research. The objective of the present work is to model and analyse the sound propagation in dissipative configurations including: (1) A central perforated passage carrying a non-uniform mean flow, and (2) high temperature and thermal variations in the central duct and the outer chamber. A mixed finite element approach is developed in the current investigation that couples a convective wave equation for inhomogeneous moving medium (in terms of an acoustic velocity potential) associated with the central duct and a pressure-based wave equation for heterogeneous stationary medium corresponding to the dissipative region. The influence of a number of parameters on the acoustic attenuation performance is investigated, including the effect of temperature, axial and radial thermal gradients and mean flow Mach number.


                     
                     Fig. 1 shows the sketch of a dissipative silencer, which consists of a perforated central duct (subdomain Ω
                     
                        a
                     ) carrying a mean flow and an outer chamber (subdomain Ω
                     
                        m
                     ) with absorbent material. The corresponding boundary surfaces are denoted by Γ
                     
                        a
                      and Γ
                     
                        m
                     , respectively, the inlet and outlet sections are represented by Γ
                     
                        i
                      and Γ
                     
                        o
                     , and the perforated surface is Γ
                     
                        p
                     . The temperature field is assumed one-dimensional in the central passage, reaching its maximum value at the inlet while decreasing gradually along the flow path [14,16,17,18,21,23]. A more general multidimensional function T(x,y,z)=T(x) is considered in the chamber [17]. Temperature variations in the silencer lead to heterogeneous properties in the propagation media as well as spatial dependence of the acoustic impedance

                     . Further details on these temperature-induced heterogeneities will be provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

It is worth noting that the variation of the mean density in the central duct due to the temperature gradient introduces a corresponding variation in the mean flow velocity and Mach number [10]. As can be seen in the figure, these axial variations of the mean flow velocity U
                     
                        mf
                      induced by the thermal gradient are also considered.

In a continuously varying temperature field, a suitable version of the wave equation is required to account for the heterogeneous properties of the air. For uniform mean flow and a constant density ρ

                        , a simple and concise convective wave equation can be used in terms of the acoustic perturbation to the pressure field [33]. An equation of comparable simplicity cannot be used, however, when the medium is moving and the corresponding velocity field varies with position [25]. In this latter case, a pressure-based wave equation includes spatial derivatives of the acoustic velocity, and therefore several dependent variables are involved. The problem can be overcome if an acoustic velocity potential-based wave equation is considered, as shown in the work of Pierce [25], where a generalization of the fundamental acoustic wave equation is derived. For the central passage depicted in Fig. 1, sound propagation is then governed by

Similarly to earlier studies [33–35], the mean flow is assumed unidirectional, with U

                        =0, and transversely uniform over the duct cross-section. Therefore, no dependence exists on the (y, z) coordinates. As indicated previously, mean flow inhomogeneity is considered, however, along the axial direction, due to the presence of a temperature gradient in the perforated central passage, thus leading to U

                         admit several boundary conditions in order to assess the acoustic attenuation performance of the silencer [33,38]. Velocity potential, acoustic velocity/pressure and impedance conditions can be applied. In practice, the former are directly introduced in the finite element equations, while Neumann and Robin conditions [36] are implemented taking into account the relations (2) and (4), repeated here for convenience,

Several modelling possibilities can be considered regarding the acoustic phenomena close to perforated screen and the appropriate radial continuity conditions through the perforations [33,34,42–44]. Continuity of acoustic radial displacement/velocity are commonly found in the literature, and it has been experimentally demonstrated that a realistic condition is between displacement and velocity [43]. In view of the good correlation between prediction and experiment observed by Elnady et al. [44] using continuity of velocity and the numerical advantages of its implementation, this condition will be retained here for all the silencer transmission loss calculations.

The vector F

                         is related to the inlet/outlet boundary conditions described in Section 2.3. The application of acoustic velocity does not produce any additional mathematical issue, as can be inferred from Eqs. (17) and (27). Acoustic pressure and/or anechoic termination can be also implemented by considering Eq. (28) and (29). In this case, additional matrices have to be computed and incorporated in the damping matrix of Eq. (41).

Absorbent materials can be modelled as equivalent fluids [30] by using complex and frequency dependent values of speed of sound c

                         (or, equivalently, the characteristic impedance Z

                           m
                         in terms of the steady airflow resistivity R. Once the resistivity is known, the equivalent acoustic properties can be expressed in terms of a number of coefficients a
                        
                           i

                         is the air density and f the frequency [30]. In the context of the current investigation, an extension is considered with R=R(x); the frequency parameter is now a function of the coordinates (x) so that the notation ξ(x) is used. Therefore, the equivalent characteristic impedance Z

Thus, the apparent difficulty associated with their possible temperature dependence has been dismissed. This is consistent with the high temperature results presented by Christie [28] and the recent experimental measurements carried out by Williams et al. [31], which have shown the validity of this hypothesis to provide an accurate prediction of the absorbent material properties.

Eqs. (42) and (43) are now used to evaluate the properties of the absorbent material for a given temperature distribution. A possible algorithm could be the following [6,7]. First, the properties of the air (ρ

As the temperature increases, however, the combination of Eqs. (44) and (45) leads to an overestimation of the material resistivity in comparison with Christie’s power law [28,31]

For example, an approximate deviation of 10% has been found at 500°C. Williams et al. [31] have recently provided further experimental validation to the use of Eq. (46). These authors have shown that the data measured at different temperatures collapse well onto Delany and Bazley curves if Eq. (46) is used for relating temperature and resistivity, and therefore the 0.6 power law will be used hereafter.

Some issues arise when a perforated duct, separating the central airway with mean flow and the absorbent material, is considered. First, how to evaluate the impact of the flow on the acoustic impedance of the perforations, and second, how to include the influence of the absorbent material. Both issues have been dealt with in the literature and a comprehensive review lies beyond the scope of this work. A number of references can be found regarding the acoustic behaviour of perforated ducts with grazing mean flow [20,33,39,41,47,48]. Good correlation with experimental results has been found in earlier studies [34] considering the model of Lee and Ih [47], which will be used in the current investigation.

According to Fig. 1, the central perforated passage is parallel to the x-axis, so that x is the only relevant coordinate when computing the acoustic impedance of the surface. Following the aforementioned work [47], the dimensionless impedance of a perforated screen with grazing mean flow is expressed here as

Lee and Ih [47] derived the coefficients from a curve fitting procedure to experimental data. The corresponding values are given in 
                        Table 2.

Eqs. (47)–(50), however, do not include the effect of the absorbent material on the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. This influence has received attention in several works [39–41]. In Ref. [39], the effect of a fibrous material on the impedance of the perforated surface was measured and the authors suggested adding a correction to the impedance obtained in the absence of material. The correction is based on replacing the density of air with the equivalent density ρ

                        . Lee et al. [40] also concluded that this procedure captures the effect of the absorbent material on the perforated duct. As shown in Ref. [34], good agreement between experimental and numerical silencer transmission loss is achieved considering an expression of the form

                        (x) is given by Eq.

To conclude, F(σ) is related to the acoustic interaction between perforations and the following expression is considered [34,42,49]

The temperature distribution in the silencer is strongly related to a number of parameters, such as the geometrical configuration, thermal conductivities and convection heat transfer coefficients determining surface heat flux from the metallic housing to the surrounding air. In addition, convection coefficients depend on numerous fluid properties, flow conditions, vehicle speed and also the geometries of the surfaces involved [50]. Engine load and speed are relevant parameters as well, and significant temperature modifications can be found by running the engine at idle condition or accelerating to a certain speed. In Ref. [16], a method is developed for estimating the temperature profiles of the exhaust gases from the surface temperatures of the exhaust piping. Concerning the silencer, the corresponding axial temperature gradient ΔT

Engines running at idle and free accelerated conditions are considered. In this latter case, the particular ranges presented in Ref. [16] at a speed of 2000rpm are 40–200°C for ΔT

                         can be also significant in exhaust silencers, and thermal gradients higher than 100°C can be found in the literature [17], resulting in complex profiles of the relevant acoustic properties.

The temperature and thermal gradients considered hereafter are based on values reported in the literature, although in some cases these have been exaggerated for a better illustration of their acoustic influence. Since the main purpose of the current investigation is to assess the impact of the thermal variations on the silencer performance, the temperature distributions used in the numerical computations are relatively simple and can be expressed analytically in terms of polynomial functions. 
                        Fig. 2 shows a sketch of the axisymmetric perforated dissipative silencer considered in the computations. As can be seen in the figure, the inlet and outlet sections are assumed to be at temperatures T

                     =0.1m are used in the finite element discretizations to guarantee plane wave propagation conditions in the inlet/outlet sections [33]. Transmission loss computations have been carried out using 8-noded axisymmetric quadrilateral elements with quadratic interpolation, the FE meshes having an approximate element size of 0.0075m to provide an accurate solution in the frequency range under analysis. Results for the three absorbent materials detailed in Table 1 (E glass, basalt wool and texturized fibre glass) will be presented in the next sections. The mean flow is defined by the Mach number M
                     
                        i
                      at the silencer inlet section, obtaining the local value M(x) from continuity of mass flow. The parameters that characterize the perforated duct are: porosity σ=0.2, thickness t

                     =0.0035m. These values are considered in all the calculations hereafter.

The influence of temperature and the corresponding axial thermal gradients are assessed first. For comparison purposes, radial temperature variations are not included in this analysis, that is, ΔT
                        
                           rad
                        =0°C. The relevant information associated with the first temperature distributions is provided in 
                        Table 3, including the values T

                        , i=1, 2, …, 6 shown in Fig. 2, and the average temperature in the absorbent material. In the three cases under analysis, the same temperature is considered at the outlet section (200°C), while the inlet temperature increases from 300°C (Case aI) to 400°C (Case aII) and 500°C (Case aIII). Thus, the values of the axial temperature gradients for the computations are ΔT
                        
                           ax
                        =100°C, 200°C and 300°C, respectively. The inlet mean flow Mach number is given by M
                        
                           i
                        =0.1.


                        
                        Fig. 3 depicts the transmission loss curves of Cases aI-aIII for a perforated dissipative silencer containing basalt wool (see material details in Table 1). Predictions presented here also include two calculations for uniform temperature fields. The former is T
                        
                           unif
                        =25°C (ΔT
                        
                           ax
                        =ΔT
                        
                           rad
                        =0°C) and corresponds to the usual “cold condition” found in the literature [1–5, 32-35], while the latter is given by T
                        
                           unif
                        =200°C (the value considered for the outlet temperature in Cases aI–aIII) to illustrate the impact of an increasing mean temperature and axial gradient in high temperature situations. For validation purposes, the mixed approach (potential/pressure) presented here is compared with a pressure-based formulation valid in the absence of flow [7] for the particular axial temperature gradient associated with Case aI.

The transmission loss predictions delivered by the mixed formulation presented here and the predictions given by the pressure formulation [7] are almost undistinguishable and an excellent agreement is obtained. As can be seen in the figure, a significant change in the silencer performance is observed as the temperature varies. A comparison between the transmission loss curves for uniform temperature fields (T
                        
                           unif
                        =25°C and T
                        
                           unif
                        =200°C) confirms the conclusions of previous studies [6,7], that is, predictions for dissipative configurations at cold conditions can differ significantly from the results at high temperature and the use of a normalized frequency f/c does not provide the transmission loss overlapping found in reactive geometries. In principle, the influence of the thermal gradient seems also relevant in the curves depicted in the figure, since increasing values of ΔT
                        
                           ax
                         lead to a deterioration of the attenuation in the frequency range of analysis. However, with Cases aI–aIII the mean temperature changes as well, the values being T
                        
                           avg
                        =250°C, T
                        
                           avg
                        =300°C and T
                        
                           avg
                        =350°C, respectively. Thus, the effect of the temperature gradient is not isolated and it is difficult to discern exactly what is affecting the silencer performance.

Therefore, further computations are required, the analysis being extended with the temperature distributions detailed in 
                        Table 4. Note that for these new calculations the temperature at the outlet section is not the same and now the axial gradients of Cases aIV and aV lead to an average temperature that equals the mean value of Case aI, that is, T
                        
                           avg
                        =250°C.


                        
                        Fig. 4 shows the results of Cases aI, aIV and aV, again for a silencer containing basalt wool. A computation with uniform temperature field (T
                        
                           unif
                        =250°C) is also included for comparison. The inlet mean flow Mach number is given by M
                        
                           i
                        =0.1.

As can be seen in the figure, higher values of ΔT
                        
                           ax
                         lead to a slight deterioration of the attenuation in the high frequency range, while no significant impact of the axial gradient is found at low and mid frequencies, even when the gradients used in the computations are considerable. The differences are now lower compared to those found in Fig. 3, since only the influence of the gradient is taken into account, the mean temperature effect being omitted. Note that, for the cases under consideration, ignoring the presence of the temperature gradient is likely to provide a slight overestimation of the silencer performance. The maximum transmission loss difference is found between the uniform temperature distribution and Case aV, the value being approximately 5% (TL=39.9dB and TL=37.7dB at 3200Hz, respectively). Thus, when designing the silencer it seems that it is only necessary to include the presence of axial temperature gradients and the associated thermal effects if accurate predictions are required in the high frequency range, while an average temperature provides a reasonable estimation at lower frequencies. A similar analysis will be presented in Section 4.2 related to radial gradients. The assessment of a simplified approach with transmission loss computations considering the average temperature in the presence of general axial and radial gradients will be provided in Section 4.3.

Material resistivity is likely to be a very influential property when modelling thermal effects. Comparing the temperature distributions detailed in Table 3, it is clear that there are significant differences. In particular, as indicated previously, the average values are T
                        
                           avg
                        =250°C, T
                        
                           avg
                        =300°C and T
                        
                           avg
                        =350°C, for Cases aI, aII and aIII, respectively. From Eq. (46), an increase in the average resistivity of the absorbent material is obtained for higher mean temperatures. 
                        Table 5 provides the corresponding average values over the dissipative region for the three materials considered in this work.

Further transmission loss results are shown in 
                        Fig. 5 considering Cases aI-aIII for texturized fibre glass and E glass. As shown in Table 5, the former is less resistive than basalt wool, while the latter exhibits a higher resistivity. The value M
                        
                           i
                        =0.1 is used in the computations.

The attenuation delivered by the configurations containing texturized fibre glass improves the results associated with E glass in almost all the frequency range. For this latter material with higher resistivity, a worse acoustic performance is found as the average temperature and the axial gradient increase, as previously observed for basalt wool in Figs. 3 and 4. Considering the texturized fibre glass, it is worth noting that the combined impact of increasing mean temperature and the associated gradient is less pronounced than in the case of basalt wool and E glass. For this less resistive material, a slight drop in the silencer performance is observed initially when changing from Case aI to Case aIII, up to a transition frequency of approximately 1250Hz. Beyond this transition frequency, however, the assessment of the acoustic behaviour shows a slight improvement, the silencer seeming more effective at attenuating sound for Case aIII. Further computations (not presented here) show that the aforementioned transition frequency also appears for higher material resistivities (E glass and basalt wool), but the associated frequencies are beyond the frequency limits considered in the current work.

Isolating the influence of the axial gradient for E glass and texturized fibre (Cases aIV and aV) delivers the transmission loss curves depicted in 
                        Fig. 6. As in Fig. 4, Case aI as well as a computation with uniform temperature field (T
                        
                           unif
                        =250°C) are also included for comparison. As in the previous figures, the inlet mean flow Mach number is given by M
                        
                           i
                        =0.1.

For both materials, higher values of ΔT
                        
                           ax
                         lead to a slight detrimental effect on the silencer transmission loss, mainly in the high frequency range. Attenuation overestimations up to 5% are obtained in the computations if the axial temperature gradient is neglected. This value is similar to the previous results found in Fig. 4 for basalt wool. Note that, from Figs. 3 and 5, it was concluded that the average temperature has a great impact on the attenuation when using high resistivity materials, while its effect is smaller for low material airflow resistivity. For the axial gradient considered separately (Figs. 4 and 6), a lower influence is found in general, more concentrated in the high frequency range, and the resistivity does not seem to play such an important role.


                        
                        Table 6 provides the temperature values T

                        , i=1, 2, …, 6, considered to analyse the influence of temperature and corresponding radial thermal variations (with ΔT
                        
                           ax
                        =0°C). The temperature at the outer surface (with r=R
                        2) is the same in these three first cases under study, its value being 200°C. The increases ΔT

                           r3 are 50°C, 100°C and 150°C for Cases bI, bII and bIII, respectively. Information is also provided regarding the average temperature in the absorbent material. The central values T
                        
                           r2 and T
                        
                           r4 are obtained by approximating a logarithmic temperature distribution along the radial coordinate [50]. As in the previous section, the inlet mean flow Mach number is M
                        
                           i
                        =0.1.

The transmission loss computations for E glass are shown in 
                        Fig. 7, including a configuration with uniform temperature T
                        
                           unif
                        =200°C (the value considered for the outer surface with r=R
                        2 in Cases bI–bIII). As can be observed in the figure, the results are consistent with the previous computations of Section 4.1. With high temperature and axial gradient and the influence on the attenuation of the temperature and the associated radial gradient is relevant. Temperature rise leads to a detrimental reduction of the acoustic performance. The silencer attenuation is seen to drop as the temperature and thermal gradient are higher. A possible reason may be associated with a saturation effect due to the high resistivity of E glass, which increases as the average temperature rises, and partially prevents the sound energy from penetrating the material in the frequency range under analysis.

To analyse the impact of the radial temperature gradient separately, Cases bIV and bV are now considered, with the temperature distributions detailed in 
                        Table 7. An average temperature of 231°C, similar to the mean value of Case bII, is taken into account.


                        
                        Fig. 8 shows the results of Cases bII, bIV and bV for a silencer containing E glass, as well as the attenuation curve provided by a computation with uniform temperature field (T
                        
                           unif
                        =231°C). According to the figure, relevant differences between the transmission loss predictions can be obtained. As opposite to the case of the axial gradient, there are now significant discrepancies resulting from the radial temperature variations, extended over the entire frequency range. It is evident in Fig. 2 that neglecting the radial temperature gradient ΔT
                        
                           rad
                         can lead to a systematic overprediction of the silencer performance, the effect being stronger as the radial thermal variation increases.

The particular values corresponding to the attenuation overestimation in Fig. 8 are detailed next. The configuration with uniform temperature field is taken as reference for comparison. Considering first Case bII, the maximum transmission loss variation is 9% at 1980Hz. For Case bIV, an approximate discrepancy of 20% appears at 2060Hz, while differences up to 28% are obtained with Case V at 2160Hz. Thus, using an average temperature for the computations does not necessarily provide accurate acoustic predictions in the cases under study. Note that, although the particular values of radial temperature gradient used for bIV and bV cases are exaggerated on purpose, the heat transfer through the outer shell can be considerable, therefore justifying the need to include transverse temperature variations in the silencer noise attenuation calculations.

In 
                        Fig. 9, a comparison between predictions for Cases bII, bIV and bV is made considering texturized fibre glass. A configuration with uniform temperature having equal average value (231°C) is also included. The predictions appear be quite similar in the frequency region depicted, with only some relevant differences close to 1500Hz. At low frequencies, higher gradients lead to a systematic reduction of the attenuation performance, while an irregular influence is found at mid to high frequency values. Thus, previous conclusions obtained from Fig. 8 for the combination of radial gradient and E glass no longer hold for low material airflow resistivity, since only a slight influence of the radial gradient is found in general.

More general temperature distributions are analysed in this section, where axial and radial temperature gradients are considered simultaneously through the values T

                        Table 8. In all the configurations under study, the average temperature over the absorbent material is the same, given by T
                        
                           avg
                        =185°C. An examination of the previous results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 shows axial thermal gradients providing a slight acoustic impact in general and radial temperature variations having a more relevant influence for medium to high material airflow resistivities. Therefore, it is expected that the simultaneous presence of both gradients will modify the silencer attenuation performance for basalt wool and E glass considered here, while texturized fibre will exhibit a smaller effect. It is worth assessing if predictions for uniform temperature computations based on the average value compare well with results corresponding to non-uniform temperature fields including axial and radial thermal variations. If so, this would be a suitable simplified approach to compute the transmission loss of silencers with temperature gradients.


                        
                        Fig. 10 depicts the transmission loss computations for Cases cI and cII considering texturized fibre and E glass. The sound attenuation associated with a uniform temperature field defined by T
                        
                           avg
                        =185°C is also calculated for comparison purposes. The inlet mean flow Mach number in the computations is M
                        
                           i
                        =0.1. As expected, different trends are found depending on the material. For the low resistivity configuration (texturized fibre glass), the maximum discrepancy between the different predictions is approximately 2dB, thus confirming the limited impact of the thermal gradient and justifying the use of a simplified approach with an average temperature value. For the high resistivity case (E glass) it is worth noting that, even when the average temperature in the absorbent material is approximately the same for all the computations, the attenuation overestimation assuming uniform temperature field can be considerable. This effect is stronger as the temperature gradients are higher; for example, the maximum TL discrepancy between the uniform temperature field and Case cI is about 3dB, while a difference higher than 5dB is found between the uniform temperature predictions and Case cII at 1920Hz. These latter results seem to indicate that, for general temperature fields including radial gradients in relatively resistive materials, an accurate and reliable prediction of the attenuation performance cannot be guaranteed if an average temperature value is considered.

Computations are carried out in this section including several inlet mean flow Mach numbers given by M
                        
                           i

                        Table 9, where axial and radial temperature gradients are considered simultaneously. The particular axial values analysed here are ΔT
                        
                           ax
                        =100°C and 200°C for Cases dI and dII, respectively, while the radial temperature variation is ΔT
                        
                           rad
                        =100°C in all the calculations. Note that the temperature distribution at the outlet section is the same in the two configurations under analysis (defined by T
                        
                           r4, T
                        
                           r5
                         and T
                        
                           r6). The results for basalt wool and the temperature distributions corresponding to Cases dI and dII are presented in 
                        Fig. 11.

In general, increasing the inlet Mach number while keeping the same temperature field yields a detrimental influence of the mean flow in almost all the frequency range under consideration, except in the highest part of the interval depicted in the figure. This is consistent with earlier results [34] obtained in the presence of mean flow at room temperature, that is, an increase in flow velocity leads to a drop in the silencer performance. For a given inlet mean flow, higher average temperature and thermal gradients lead to lower attenuation in the frequency interval considered. However, the transition frequency for the case with M
                        
                           i
                        =0 has shifted to lower frequencies and it is slightly higher than 3200Hz (the intersection between the solid black line and dash black line can be inferred from the figure). This transition shifts towards higher frequencies beyond the figure limits as the mean flow velocity rises. Note that, for a given thermal field, as the temperature decreases along the central passage, opposite density and speed of sound variations take place, resulting in a small reduction between the inlet and outlet Mach numbers.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A finite element model has been derived for the acoustic analysis of perforated dissipative silencers with high temperature and thermal gradients in the presence of mean flow. The spatial variations of the temperature field have been shown to generate heterogeneities in the mean flow as well as in the properties of the sound propagation media (air and absorbent material). For the central passage, an acoustic velocity potential-based wave equation has been considered, valid for non-uniform mean flow and inhomogeneous fluid (air) with properties that vary with position. Concerning the outer chamber, the absorbent material has been modelled by its complex equivalent acoustic properties. The temperature-induced variations of these properties have been evaluated through a heterogeneous temperature-dependent resistivity in combination with absorbent material models obtained at room temperature. A pressure-based wave equation valid for variable properties and stationary medium has been then used with the equivalent density and speed of sound varying as functions of the spatial coordinates. The acoustic connection between the central passage and the outer chamber has been carried out by means of the acoustic impedance of the perforated duct. The dependence of this impedance on the heterogeneous properties of the absorbent material and the non-uniform mean flow has led to a spatial variation of the acoustic coupling and also to additional convective terms in the governing equations.

Several computational predictions have been obtained considering different temperature fields and mean flow Mach numbers in combination with a number of absorbent materials. A detailed analysis of the silencer performance has shown that, for an accurate prediction, it is necessary to include the temperature effects when modelling the acoustic behaviour. For high material flow resistivity, increasing mean temperature have been shown to deliver a general reduction in the sound attenuation. Similar conclusions have been found for axial and radial thermal gradients, although axial temperature variations have exhibited a reduced impact. Therefore, a suitable representation of the thermal effects is required to avoid an overestimation of the silencer performance. For less resistive materials, an increase in temperature and/or thermal gradient has led to a slight drop in the silencer performance in the low to mid frequency range but the opposite trend has been found at higher frequencies, the transition point shifting to higher frequencies as the temperature gradient and/or mean flow rise. In general, for some silencer configurations it may be relatively accurate to approximate the temperature field by using a uniform profile considering an average value. It has been shown, however, that this is not always possible, the model implemented here being primarily intended for use with bulk materials having medium to high airflow resistivities. In this latter case, attenuation overestimation is likely to be predicted if the temperature distribution is not taken into account, justifying the current numerical implementation. Finally, the influence of the mean flow on the transmission loss is consistent with earlier results obtained at room temperature, with higher Mach numbers leading to a drop in the silencer performance.
