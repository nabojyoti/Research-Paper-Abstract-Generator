                  In the past, structural model updating methods have been widely researched as a means to reconcile mathematical models because the key parameters in dynamic systems often change during their life cycle due to repair and replacement of parts or the environment. However, there is very little literature that references model updating under the condition of complicated multi-physics fields such as a high temperature environment (HTE). In this paper, model updating in an HTE is proposed based on the hierarchical method, and an iterative procedure is presented. With this method, the temperature field updating of a structure is taken as the first stage, and the multi-objective optimization method and a surrogate model of radial-basis functions are introduced to improve the robustness and efficiency of this stage, respectively. Then, the temperature distribution achieved from the former is imposed on the structure as a thermal load, and the residuals of the modal characteristics are taken as objective functions to update the dynamic model of the structure in HTE. The proposed method is tested on an FE model of a wing model, and the analysis of variance approach is employed to evaluate the parameter variability significance and to select the updating variable. The results of the study show that the developed hierarchical method is capable of identifying the input parameters of the temperature field and structure with good accuracy.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The supersonic vehicle has been the subject of active research for over three decades due to its many unique attributes and the resulting potential for a variety of applications. Prior research in the area of thermo-vibration was conducted for hypersonic vehicle programs. Andrew [1] researched the temperature-dependent modal test and analysis method of the X-34 FASTRAC composite rocket nozzle. The hypersonic flutter and the thermo vibration analysis have been widely researched by the present authors [2,3]. Chang et al. [4,5] proposed the thermo-vibration function in landscape orientation for isotropic and orthotropic plates based on a nonlinear coupled thermoelastic analysis. The Boeing Company [6] created a list of knowledge gaps and the capabilities needed to overcome these gaps and predicted the benefits if the gaps were removed. Based on the historical and current research completed and the technology experimental vehicle (TX-V) data provided, a large portion of the limitations are found to be related to the temperature distribution. Nevertheless, abundant information sources to refer to for dynamic analysis of supersonic vehicles are still not available.

Supersonic vehicles are always subjected to an extremely high surface temperature and large temperature gradients, which can seriously affect the modal characteristics of the structure and can affect the aeroelastic and aeroservoelastic stability of the vehicles. Usually, the finite element (FE) model analysis methods are to be employed to predict instability. Hence, accurately determining the modal characteristics of these structures at elevated temperatures is vital. However, the complexity of this problem, caused by the high speed flow and high temperature environment (HTE), has made it difficult to directly establish an accurate dynamic model. In practice, the temperature field is applied to the structure as an external load to simulate the environment of a hypersonic vehicle in the working state. Therefore, an accurate model of temperature fields is a precondition for updating the FE model for supersonic vehicles.

It is well known that thermal property estimation, boundary heat flux reconstruction and heat source identification are the most important factors for the temperature field model. Fortunately, the heat flux gauges are available to measure heat flux directly. However, this is not applicable for thermophysical parameter estimation, which is an imperative problem because of its significant influence on temperature distribution [7]. Therefore, in the literature, there have been several papers that discuss the inverse problems of the thermophysical parameters. Sawaf et al. [8] estimated the constant thermal conductivity coefficients for orthotropic materials using both the conjugate gradient and the Levenberg–Marquardt methods. Sahoo et al. [9] used different curve fitting techniques to recover the temperature history of a real time flight based on temperature data, which was obtained by a nickel film sensor during a supersonic flight test, and the results have been compared. Gosselin et al. [10] reviewed when and how Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used in the field of heat transfer over the last 15 years. With the development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in recent years, the Bayesian statistical inference method [11] was introduced to estimate parameters and thermal history reconstruction problems, including the boundary heat flux and heat source reconstruction.

Similarly, structural model updating plays an important role in dynamic modeling of supersonic vehicles. Finite element model updating approaches to improve the accuracy of a finite element prediction based on measured data are now well known and widely used in many industries. Mottershead et al. [12] and Doeblinget et al. [13] comprehensively reviewed the model updating methods of structural models. Goge [14] found a new way of updating analytical models of A320 using modal data obtained from a ground vibration test. Farid et al. [15] updated complex aerospace structures within the Bayesian framework using modal data, and a neural network was adopted to replace the computationally intensive evaluation of a full finite element analysis. Although considerable research has been devoted to model updating in industry, considerably less attention has been paid to model updating under the condition of complicated multi–physics fields such as the working condition of supersonic vehicles.

In addition, it is well known that both the thermophysical parameter estimation and structural model updating can be solved by GAs based on optimization procedures, due to their great performance in global optimization problems. GAs were first introduced by Bagley [16] in 1967. GAs implement a stochastic searching procedure and operate with a population of chromosomes, which are genotype representations of the physical variables. The feasible space of the variables is continuously explored by GAs when searching for the optimal variable set by using two genetic operators, namely crossover and mutation. Through the application of selection, crossover and mutation on the current population, a new and likely better population will be generated. In general, this process repeats for a number of times (generations) before satisfactory results are reached. It should be noted that this optimization algorithm would generally be expensive when, for example, the range of parameters is extensive or the numbers of parameters is large. This problem is largely overcome by the use of a metamodel as a surrogate for the physical model.

The idea of metamodeling is to construct a surrogate for the full finite element mathematical model using the values of some sampling points determined by experimental design methods, such as full factorial design (FFD) and central composite design (CCD). The response surface methodology (RSM), among the commonly used metamodels in optimization, has been the predominant method primarily because of its efficiency and simplicity [17,18]. However, the drawback of RSM is that it is not suitable to create models for highly nonlinear problems, in contrast to radial basis functions (RBF). Moreover, RBFs showed a great result for both large-scale and small-scale problems based on multiple performance criteria when compared with other metamodeling techniques [19].

The focus of this study is to find a new way of updating for the structure in a high-temperature environment. The remaining sections of the paper are organized as follows. In Section 2, a brief overview of the RBF as one type of metamodel is provided. The hierarchical methodology and iterative procedure for model updating in a high-temperature environment are given in Section 3. In Section 4, the method is validated by a wing finite element model, and the results are discussed. This discussion is followed by the concluding remarks in Section 5.

The RBF is a commonly used metamodeling technique in optimization, structural health monitoring and model updating. An RBF, as one type of methodology for scattered multivariate data interpolation [20], is constructed with a series of basic functions that are symmetric and centered at each sampling point. In this section, we give a brief overview of the RBF.

A generalized form of the RBF predictor for a system with n sampling points can be written based on the equation of the RBF, given as

Generally speaking, it would not be possible to check the RBF fitness with statistical analysis techniques because an RBF passes through all of the sampling points exactly, which means that the function values from the metamodel and the real function values at the sampling points are equal. In this article, we use those points that are predicted by RBF and are different from sampling points to check the fitness of the surrogate. The major statistical parameters used for evaluating model fitness are root mean square error (RMSE) and estimate coefficients-R

                      is the mean value of sample points. The RMSE value represents the percentage of the error in the average value; generally speaking, the larger the value of the former and the smaller the value of the latter ones, the better is the fit.

It is well-known fact that the effect of the temperature field on the deformation field is not a one-way phenomenon: the temperature distribution of a structure can vary with its deformation, which is caused by heat exchange, and the mechanical and thermal aspects are coupled and inseparable [22]. However, this coupling considerably complicates the computational aspect of solving actual thermo-elastic problems. In addition, the vibration frequencies are slightly changed by the effect of thermoelectric coupling [23]. Hence, Nowinski [22] suggested discounting the coupling in practice and separately evaluating the temperature and deformation fields, in this order. That method is defined as a partially coupled thermo-mechanical problem considering the temperature as the primary variable. The temperature field as an external load, which is determined by solving the heat conduction problem, is applied to the structure. Furthermore, we negligent the effect of the structural vibration on the temperature field.

Because the partially coupled thermo-mechanical models are extensively employed in the analysis of typical aeronautical structures [24,25], in this paper, the temperature field is updated as the first stage. The second stages takes the result as the thermal load when updating the dynamic model of the structure. The model updating approach proposed in this paper is based on this ideological framework.

                        Eq. (12) shows that the errors come from two sources. The first source is the uncertainty of the temperature field, and the second is the uncertainty of the independent parameters of the dynamic model. Because there is a partial coupling effect between them, we divide the high-temperature system into a temperature field model and a dynamic model that can be updated. Usually, we take the norm of the dynamic response as the objective function for model updating and obtain the following inequality based on the property of the norm and Eq.

                        Eq. (14) indicates that an accurate model of the temperature field could contribute to the response results of the structure in a high-temperature environment. Based on optimization theory for large-scale systems, we can conclude that the optimization results of a subsystem (temperature field updating) are simply the global optimization results of the total system (dynamic model updating in the HTE).

Although the metamodels are very efficient for the optimization problem when the sampling point size is not large, it may introduce some slight extra errors into the objective function and cause the problem to be ill-suited for optimization. For that reason, the multi-objective optimization method is introduced to improve the robustness of the optimization with the structure objective function, the sum of residuals of different temperature distributions with weighting factors. The new objective function J

                        where n is the number of temperature test points in the lth temperature distributions. The GA method, as a robust nongradient method, is employed to estimate the thermophysical parameters based on metamodels; using this methodology could improve the search efficiency and could circumvent difficulties of nonconvergence when the parameters are correlated or similar.

When using Eq. (19), in general, the greater the number of temperature distributions with different types, the greater is the probability that an optimal solution corresponding to objective function is the real solution. It should be noted that the process of identification is conducted in the temperature distribution with large gradients to estimate the relationship of the parameters and the temperature in the range of interest; however, that is always a very difficult task.

The detailed process of model updating in an HTE is shown as follows: 
                        Fig. 1.

The FE model of wing structure in an HTE will be used as an example to check the feasibility of the hierarchical updating methodology that is proposed in this paper. Typically, the variability of the dynamic characteristic of the test piece in a high-temperature experiment is supposed to arise not only from the decrease of the material stiffness and the thermal stress of a structure but also from the change of the boundary condition and gap state. Therefore, as shown in 
                        Fig. 2, the boundary condition is fixed in the beam of a wing, assuming that the boundary condition and the stiffness will be changed with environmental temperature and that the end faces of the wing are nearly in contact with the rigid wall. The FE model updating of this structure is performed by considering the effects of a structural gap on the boundary condition and using the spring elements to simulate the stresses that are caused by the linear expansion phenomenon of material while taking the spring stiffness as structural updating parameters in the FE model.

The wing is made of an aluminum alloy with the material properties of density ρ=2800kg/m3, Young's modulus E=76GPa, Poisson's ratio υ=0.3 and linear expansion coefficient γ=2.05e−5m/K. Because the FE model is only used to validate the method of updating the model, in this section, we make the following assumptions to simplify the specific process.

The actual values of thermal conductivity, which are the temperatures of the quadratic polynomial, are assumed to be unknown, and the polynomial coefficients are listed in 
                        Table 1. The emissivity is constant as 0.09 [26], and the experimental data are simulated by a combination FEA analysis using the actual value and Gaussian noise.

The temperature-dependent parameters of the dynamic model, such as Young's modulus and the linear expansion coefficient, are not varied with the temperature or have been updated such that they can be performed by a simple test article with the same material in a free-free boundary condition.

Considering that the contact stiffness with the rigid wall in the normal direction (Z) is constant, the contact force, which is caused by thermal stresses that will affect the vibration characteristics of the wing, is the linear relationship with temperature. We assume that the value of contact stiffness is 4.35e6N/m and that it does not vary with temperature.

Usually, it is not known in advance which metamodels have the highest fitness before the surrogate is used in model updating. The accuracy of the metamodel, on the other hand, is very important for successful studies; therefore, we selected six types of RBF and developed a model for the heat conduction problem to investigate the appropriateness of the metamodels.

The six RBFs are:
                           
                              (a)
                              Gaussian

Inverse-multiquadric;

Multiquadric;

Gaussian with linear polynomial;

Inverse-multiquadric with linear polynomial;

Multiquadric with linear polynomial.

There are three design variables because we assume that the thermal conductivity is the temperature of the quadratic polynomial. To take into account the accuracy of the surrogate and computational cost, we use the five-level central composite design and add some sample points at the diagonal of the design space for a total of 45 sample points, which are simulated by the FE code MSC/NASTRAN, to construct the RBF models. The RBF models created with the Gaussian, Inverse multiquadric, and Multiquadric models are represented by the symbols “RBF-GS”, “RBF-IMQ”, and “RBF-MQ”, respectively. The augmented RBF models are represented by adding “−LP” to the symbols of those without augmentation.

We used seven-level FFD in the design space; those points differ from the sample points and are calculated by the RBF predictor to evaluate the fitness of the metamodels, and the R
                        2 and RMSE values are calculated using Eq. (6). The results are shown in 
                        
                        Figs. 3 and 4. It can be observed that the metamodels constructed by functions (d)–(f) give better overall prediction than functions (a)–(c); the functions (a)–(c), especially functions (a) and (b), cannot suitably represent the objective functions of condition No. 1 and condition No. 2 (as shown in Fig. 5). In contrast, all of the models augmented with a linear polynomial did well with regard to the objective functions of No. 1 and No. 2. The poor predictability of models in functions (a)–(c) may in fact be caused by the properties of the No. 1 and No. 2 distributions, which appear to have certain linear characters.

Among the six RBFs, function (f), the multiquadric with linear polynomial, is identified to be the most stable function for all three objectives. Therefore, the models created by the multiquadric with linear polynomials are selected to perform the identification and model updating in the following sections.

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

Three different conditions of the temperature field, namely antisymmetric, symmetric and asymmetric, are shown in 
                           Fig. 5 and are represented by No. 1 to No. 3. The polynomial coefficient as the updating variables, the RBF-MQ-LP predictor of the objective function as Eq. (19), would be established to identify the thermal conductivity of a rectangular plate that shares the same material as the wing. The statistical analysis results are given in Table 1, which shows that the RMSE value and R
                           
                              2
                            value are 6.66e-4 and 0.9735, respectively. These low value of RMSE and the high value of R
                           
                              2
                            indicate that the metamodel is a good predictor for Eq. (19) and that it can be used for model updating of the temperature field. The exact values along with the estimated values are also given in Table 1. We found that the maximum error is 1.8% and that the minimum error is 0.27%. To check the anti-noise of the proposed identification method of thermophysical parameters, Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 5°C is also added to the experimental data and identification work is carried out; the results are given in Table 1. The maximum coefficient error in this condition is equal to just 1.8%. This finding suggests that, although the noise level had been increased, the effects on the estimate errors are not as significant; the identification method employed in this paper has a high identification accuracy, which means that the method based on multi-objective optimization methodology has certain robustness characteristics.

The updating process reaches the same global minimum for all sets, which is shown by the smoothness of the objective functions used for the polynomial coefficient of thermal conductivity in 
                           Fig. 6. The red point depicts the minimum value of the objective functions. It is clearly visible that there is a local minimum in the parameters' space; fortunately, that problem can be overcome with GAs, owing to their excellent performance in the global optimization problem.

Parameter selection is a precondition for model updating, and the response must be sensitive to parameter variations. The solution to this problem can generally be found by sensitivity analysis; however, this approach only reflects the local sensitivity of the parameter to the response, rather than global design space. Fortunately, this problem can be overcome with the analysis of variance (ANOVA), which is a more efficient and reliable method used for significance evaluation. In ANOVA, the total variance of a group of samples due to parameter effects can be estimated based on the F-test evaluation [27].

In this paper, ANOVA is implemented using three-level CCD, which is a global design technique with small sample sizes; therefore, it is particularly suitable for parameter screening purposes. In this design, the first four frequencies of the wing are adopted as the responses. Each updating variable, which is the boundary stiffness of the wing in the translation DOF, is allowed to have normalized values of -1,0,1, representing those at the lower bound, the initial design, and the upper bound. We can obtain the initial identification space, 1e6–1e7N/m, by comparing the FEA results and the experimental data. The design matrix and the FE simulations are given in 
                           Table 2. Three stiffnesses of a wing in TDOF and their interaction terms have been investigated for their significance to the response using the previously described ANOVA , and a summary of the results is shown in 
                           Fig. 7. The results indicate that the stiffness of the Z direction shows a high significance, similar to the first three orders' frequencies, and its significance is close to 100%. However, it decreases to approximately 20% for the fourth-order frequency, while that of the Y direction sharply increases up to approximately 58% at this point. Meanwhile, the significance of the X direction increases to approximately 9%. In addition, all of the frequencies are not sensitive to the change in the interaction terms. Because the ANOVA has demonstrated well that the frequencies are sensitive to the boundary stiffness of the Y and Z direction, in the next section, we will use them to update the dynamic model of the wing.

Once the temperature field has been updated, it will be taken into the wing model as a thermal load. Because there are only two variables to be identified, the wing finite element model is updated with the GAs directly by taking the spring stiffness, which simulates the contact stiffness of an end face and a rigid wall, as the updated variable. The first four modes of the wing are computed, and the mode shapes are illustrated in 
                           Fig. 8.

The identification values of the stiffness are shown in 
                           Table 3. It is observed that the maximum error in the identified translational stiffness of the Z direction is 5.7%, whereas the error in the Y direction values can be completely erroneous. Nevertheless, there are slight differences between the modals of the updated model, which are generated by the identified model parameters, and the test ones, as shown in 
                           Table 4. The maximum errors in frequency can be observed to be 0.63%, and the minimum MAC value is 0.96. That result means that the updated model results correlate very well with the test data in the range of study. It is quite possible that major effect of the dynamic responses of the wing is represented by the translation stiffness of the Z direction in a boundary whose identified value deviates from the actual value by less than −6%. Hence, it can be concluded that having large errors in the identified values of the Y direction will not deteriorate the modals for the wing, as long as the translational stiffness of the Z direction is accurately identified, and the model updating method proposed in this study can be used for practical applications.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this manuscript, the problem of dynamic model updating in an HTE is presented. By employing the hierarchical method, we decompose the problem into temperature field updating and dynamic structural updating, and an implementation process for this approach based on the RBF predictor and GAs is given. The method is verified in an FE model of the wing with respect to the effect of the contact stiffness in the boundary. The results show that the developed hierarchical method is capable of identifying and updating the input parameters of the temperature field and the structure with high accuracy and efficiency by using metamodels. To ensure the reliability of the surrogate, statistical analysis techniques are employed to check the fitness of the RBF models.

The metamodels, which are developed to estimate the thermophysical parameters, may introduce some additional errors when the sampling point size is small, and those errors and the measured noise will cause some issues for the objective function. Therefore, a multi-objective optimization method is introduced to improve the robustness of the optimization with a structure objective function, which is the sum of the residuals of different temperature distributions with weighting factors, and this methodology has been validated by numerical example.

The method of dynamic structural model updating for identifying the model parameter values based on the accurately calibrated model of the temperature field has been proposed. In the numerical example, the boundary condition is changed with the environmental temperature and we consider the effect of the structural gap on the boundary condition by introducing the spring elements. ANOVA is carried out to quantitate the sensitivity of the dynamic model parameters in the updating space. It is indicated that the boundary stiffness of the Z direction shows high significance to the modal responses, while boundary stiffness of the X direction and the interaction terms have a negligible effect on the calculated modals of the structure. Thus, it is concluded that having large errors in the identified values of the Y direction will not deteriorate the modals for the wing, as long as the translational stiffness of the Z direction is accurately identified.
