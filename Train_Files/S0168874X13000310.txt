                  In this investigation a coupling between a 3D solid-shell element for the analysis of multilayered composite shell structures and a specific response surface method is proposed.

A particular attention is given to alleviate shear, trapezoidal and thickness locking, without resorting to the classical plane-stress assumption.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In the modeling of shell structures various problems may appear especially when shell finite elements are used in combination with solid elements. Therefore special connection elements are necessary to link shell elements with solids having different degrees of freedom. It turns obvious to develop general-purpose brick elements, which are able to deal with any type of structures (solid, shell, and/or their combination).

3D-continuum elements are a variety of Finite Element (FE) models halfway between solid elements and thin shells. They have the same freedom configuration of solid elements but account for shell-like behavior in the thickness direction. They are very attractive for modeling shell-like regions of a 3D structure without the need of special elements to connect solid elements to shell nodes. 3D-continuum elements also called solid-shell elements have many benefits compared to the degenerated shell elements, mainly because of the simplicity of their kinematics, their ability in modeling complex structures generally composed of massive and thin-walled regions and also special rotations treatment in geometric nonlinear analysis may be avoided.

The 3D-continuum FE concept has attracted many researchers since the late 1990s. Domissy et al. [15] and Sze et al. [37] are probably the first authors to investigate a solid-shell approach for the analysis of plates and shells. In 1998, Hauptmann and Schweizerhof [20] propose an extension to the original solid-shell theory called double-node models where the position of an arbitrary point in the element is assumed to depend either linearly or quadratically, on the thickness coordinate. In 1998, Cho et al. [12] proposed a solid-shell element model based on the assumed strain formulation for buckling and postbuckling analysis of shell structures.

During the last decade, solid-shell FE models for thin shell structures have attracted considerable attention. Numerous models have been proposed in the literature and can be found in Sze and Yao [38], Vu-Quoc and Tan [40], Areias et al. [3], Harnau and Schweizerhof [19], Alves de Sousa et al. [2], Hannachi et al. [18], Quy and Matzenmiller [32], Nguyen et al. [29], Shiri et al. [35] and more recently the work of Schwarze and Reese [34], Moreira et al. [25]. Solid-shell element properties make them appropriate also for the modeling of laminated structures as can be seen in some representative references [3,21,25,33,40], to name just a few. In all of these works it has been shown that it is possible to use a solid-shell finite element models which possess no rotational degrees of freedom and obtain good results for the resolution of various structural problems. However, development of these elements is not straightforward, transverse shear, trapezoidal and thickness locking phenomena must be alleviated and therefore special treatments have to be included to suppress the numerical locking effects become crucial.

Transverse shear locking is characterized by an overestimation of stiffness associated to transverse shear strain energy [2]. The most common methods that have been used to solve the shear locking effect are the Selective Reduced Integration (SRI) scheme [2] and also the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) which has been applied firstly on shells by Dvorkin and Bathe [17] and as can be seen in the works of [3,11,15,35] for a fully integrated solid-shell element.

Trapezoidal locking is only found in structures where the directors of the element edges are not perpendicular to the mid-plane. One method to resolve this pathology is by using the ANS interpolation of the transverse strain in thickness direction as performed in [8,9,37,38], where it was proposed to avoid artificial thickness straining.

Thickness locking, caused by Poisson's ratio coupling to the in-plane and transverse normal stress and normal strain responses [14,15] can be overcome by plane-stress assumption, or more generally by the Enhanced Assumed thickness Strain (EAS), where a 7th parameter is added [10,21] and suppressed by condensation technique. This locking pathology usually appears when a solid-shell element with only translational degrees of freedom is to be used in problems involving bending.

The 7th parameter as proposed by Büchter and Ramm [10] is an extension of classical shear deformation theory. The interest of this model is especially useful when full three-dimensional constitutive law is used which allows solving problems involving large strains. In their work, Büchter and Ramm [10] describe the 7th parameter model along with a FE formulation and they introduce it on the element level by means of the hybrid-mixed formulation. In the present solid-shell model, the 7th parameter is resulting independently from the FE formulation, i.e. it can be understood as semi-discretization of the solid-shell element through the thickness. Based on this technique, the obtained 7th parameter model is considered simply as a two-dimensional continuous concept with 7 degrees of freedom per node of the reference surface. The 7th parameter is then eliminated using the static condensation procedure on the element level.

Another alternative, has been proposed recently by Professor Brunet and his collaborators [4], concerning a solid-shell element with 9 nodes: 8 are located at the element vertices and the 9th is located at the centroid. The authors used classically a reduced integration with one in-plane quadrature point with an assumed shear-strain field to avoid locking phenomena. The centroid node is used as an extra parameter to enhance the displacement in the thickness direction and thus obtain a linear normal strain, allowing the use of full three-dimensional constitutive strain–stress behavior.

During last few years, Response Surface Method (RSM) [24] has gained more and more importance in the optimization of general shell structures [30]. RSM has the advantage of replacing a complex response model by an approximate one based on results calculated at various points in the design space. The optimization is then performed at a lower cost over such response surfaces. Two important issues when applying RSM to a particular problem concern the Design of Experiments (DOE) and construction of accurate approximation functions [13,22] so that rapid convergence may be achieved.

In the present work, we exploit the RSM based on Diffuse Approximation (DA) [7,26] and particularly the notion of pseudo-derivative to design a specific optimization technique, custom built for this regression model. This new method is an extension of pattern search in two aspects: (1) accommodation of arbitrary regular and irregular patterns; (2) design points eligible for inclusion in any pattern instance belong to a predefined set in the design where experiments are authorized.

The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the kinematics, the material law, and the variational equations of a 3D-shell formulation with convective coordinates with the associated FE description. A special technique, which is necessary for integration through the layers in the 3D-case, is also given. In Section 3 the optimization procedure dedicated for the design of material parameters is given, a special attention is set to the built of response surface model, we use to approximate the implicit objective function. In the fourth section we discuss the applicability of the proposed procedure which consists in coupling between RSM, DOE and solid-shell solution for the modeling of several standard benchmarks which have been given by NAFEMS [28]. The obtained results are compared with those obtain using

                      commercial software via its solid-shell element called SC8R. Finally some conclusions are drawn.

To overcome the difficulties of rotational degrees of freedom (dof) in conventional shell elements, the shell kinematics of deformation is described using the position vectors of a pair of material points at the top and at the bottom of the shell mid-surface (Fig. 1
                        ).

In this kinematic description, a straight transverse fiber before deformation remains straight after deformation. Such transverse fiber does not need necessarily to be normal to the shell mid-surface before deformation, as well as after deformation. With respect to nodal designation (Fig. 2
                        ), the coordinate vector

In the context of modeling multilayered composite structures using solid-shell elements, there exist two possibilities regarding the numerical implementation:
                           
                              
                                 
                                    •
                                 
                              
                              
                                 Case of one element per layer: This is the easiest way for modeling the entire thickness of the structure using several elements (1 element per layer) as indicated in Fig. 5
                                 . In this case the numerical procedure of integration is straightforward and does not require any efforts in the implementation compared to the case of isotropic material modeling. The user has to provide the following basic properties:
                                    
                                       1.
                                       
                                          Declaration of n groups of different elements in the FE mesh, these groups correspond to the n different material layers constituting the laminate.
                                       


                                          Provide the physical characteristics of each layer.
                                       


                                 Case of several layers per element: This second technique consists in stacking the different material layers within the same element (see Fig. 5). Each FE is a stack of several layers, therefore stress calculation and numerical integration of the stiffness matrix is carried out using the “single-layer approach” identical to the one commonly used for the integration of plasticity, by using either one or several Lobatto integration points through the thickness for each layer.

In the present investigation, this second method has been implemented because it is more general and more convenient since it requires only one element in the thickness of the structure (gain of CPU time in the case of industrial applications). On the other side the drawback the chosen element kinematic will not be able to capture delamination effects.

In this case, the numerical implementation of the FE model requires some modifications of the stresses calculation and the integration of the stiffness matrix. For each element the user has to provide the following properties:

                         represents the layer thickness and h is the total thickness of the structure.

Eq. (29) implies that for each layer of material, all operators are reported to the mid-plane of every layer i then the numerical integration is performed using Lobatto integration scheme with N points through the thickness direction. In the present model, 2 Lobatto integration points are used in the thickness direction for each layer, since all applications involve only elastic material behavior, for the case of material nonlinearities, at least 5 integration points will be necessary to achieve a correct stress integration.

A solid-shell element formulated using Eqs. (26)–(28) with standard integration based on 2×2×N Gauss schema will fail because of numerous locking phenomena.

An effective method of resolving shear locking is the Assumed natural Strain method in which the natural transverse shear strains are sampled and then interpolated at some discrete element points. The transverse shear strains

Similar to shear locking, trapezoidal locking occurs when lower order elements such as 8-node hexahedral elements are used to model curved shells so that their cross-sections assume the trapezoidal shape these excessive number of sampled thickness strains can be reduced by using a bilinear interpolation of the transverse normal strains sampled at the four corners of the element mid-surface (Fig. 7

Poisson's ratio coupling requires the thickness strain to be a linear function of 
                           ζ
                        . Because our solid-shell element has only two layers, as consequence the thickness strain does not vary with 
                           ζ
                         thus the element fail in reproducing the plane-stress condition. In order to obtain a linear distribution of the normal strain in thickness direction, we enhance the thickness strain field by adding an internal degree of freedom as

The approximation Eq. (41) is based on a set of numerical experiments with the function f. Generally, the approximate functions encountered in RSM rely on second-order models, over a given region of interest, with the constant regression coefficients fitted by means of least squares. The idea in this work is to apply minimization algorithm progression by building new response surfaces centered each successive solution (Fig. 8
                     ). During the progression of the process, the region of interest moves and new numerical experiments are performed at each iteration, which is known as the Moving Least Square (MLS) approximation.

In the present investigation, we explore the application of DA regression for building the response surface during the iterative process. In the DA Method used in this work [26,27], the approximating functions are polynomials fitted to the nodal values of each local domain by a weighted least squares approximation. Belytschko et al. [7] developed an Element Free Galerkin (EFG) method which is an alternative implementation using Moving Least Square (MLS) approximation [24]. In this paper we adopt the moving least squares (MLS) interpolation. In the DAM the idea is to replace the OF f(x) computed using the FE method, for a local moving square fitting. The resulting function

                      is more regular that the function of the FE method, since the discontinuous coefficients are placed, by continuous functions of weight, which gives a continuity

                     . The approximate function becomes smooth by using continuous weighting functions. Different weight functions have been proposed in the literature, they differ in both the shape of the domain of influence, and in functional form. The truncated Gaussian spherical weight function used in this work is given by (Fig. 9
                     )

                        β
                      affects the shape of the weight function. Generally, small values of the parameter 
                        β
                      lead to a smooth and diffuse approximation but with the cost of a slow convergence process, and for larger values of 
                        β
                      the optimization process converges more rapidly but increases the risk of divergence. Through the present investigation, it has been found by the authors, that 
                        β
                        ≥
                        2
                      (Fig. 9) is a good compromise since it insures a good convergence rate while maintaining a certain amount of diffusive character on the approximation.

The approximation is local, which means that only the points closest to the current optimum are taken into account (Fig. 10
                     ). The approximation coefficients are continuous when panning and/or zooming of the region of interest is performed.

Once the objective function is estimated, then an optimization algorithm can be used to minimize the resulting OF. In this work we have adopted an algorithm based on a Sequential Quadratic Programming technique [31] and a second algorithm based on the Simplex method. Both algorithms are robust enough and suitable to deal with constrained nonlinear optimization problems. But any Minimization algorithm may be used at this stage.

We have to notice, that as the minimization procedure is an iterative process, therefore at least few iterations (generally less than 10) are often needed for the SQP algorithm in order to find the optimal solution of the metamodel obtained using the RSM based on DA.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the solid-shell FE model defined previously, several benchmarks are carried out with the aim of studying its behavior regarding the locking phenomena, as well as the global rate of convergence.

The problem considered is the analysis of a flat plate made from two layers oriented at ±45°, subjected to a uniform pressure loading. The example verifies simple laminated composite plate analysis. Our numerical results are compared with the analytical solution given in Spilker et al. [36] and a second verification is done by a comparison to the results obtained using

The structure is a two-layer, composite, orthotropic, square plate that is simply supported on its bottom edges. The layers are oriented at ±45° with respect to the plate edges. Fig. 11
                         shows the plate dimensions and the loading pressure which is applied on the top surface of the plate. Each layer has the material properties given in Table 1

The structure is a 7-layer, composite, orthotropic, rectangular strip that is simply supported on its supports on A and B and subjected to a line load of 10N/mm at C onto the top surface (Fig. 12

The structure, with length L=12m, width b=6m and thickness h=0.1m is clamped on its thicker side and the free thinner end is subjected to a transverse normal load distribution uniformly along the free edge equivalent to a concentrated force of F=600N. The location of the ply drop-offs are at x=4m and x=8m with the top two layers removed after each drop-off. The layer material properties are given in Table 5

At first and prior to the optimization of the material parameters, the cylinder is modeled using the initial material data and a mesh of 40 elements through its circumference, 10 elements through the length and only 1 element in thickness direction. The circumferential stress at z=0 is measured for 2 radius values (R=23mm, R=27mm) and compared to the NAFEMS reference solution [28] and to the one obtained using the

                        . Before performing the optimization procedure, a DOE based on composite design (Fig. 15
                        a) built of 9 functions evaluations for the full cylinder, is carried out. In this case we used 3 groups of design points (4 two-level factorial design points, 4 axial points and a 1 center point). Then design variables are coded as (−1, +1) in order to facilitate the data treatment. The DOE plan with the OF values is given in Table 7
                        .

                         of the upper orthotropic lightweight based aramid layer and the Young's modulus E of the lower aluminum alloy layer, while the maximal deflection under load is maintained equal to 15mm. The objective function is based on the general Hill criterion [1] and defined by Eq. (51).

In this application, a composite leaf spring for automobile suspension is studied. The structure shown in Fig. 24
                         with a 10mm constant thickness is made of a composite orthotropic material whose mechanical characteristics are given in Table 8
                        . The optimization problem here, consists in finding the best orientation of the material fibers which allows reducing the maximal stresses over the structure under ultimate loading conditions.

The FE mesh using 1220 solid-shell elements and the boundary conditions and loading are shown in Fig. 24. The structure supports a concentrated force at its free end (applied on the bottom shell surface) of 500N, the other edge being clamped.

Prior to the optimization process, the FE model has been validated using initial material parameters with an orientation angle

                         shows the stress distribution on the top flange of the structure in the 1st principal direction. Comparison of maximal values of S
                        11 obtained using the present solid-shell model gave 185.79MPa which is almost the same maximal value 185.41MPa obtained with the SC8R element of

                         (This results from the fact that the SC8R solid-shell element of

                         results shows good agreement. This first study confirms that the present model is valid and therefore the optimization process can be performed.

In order to reduce the number of evaluations of the OF, a DOE based on the Box-Behnken algorithm is used with three levels coded between {−1, 0, +1} (Fig. 15b). The Box-Behnken DOE with 5 variables, allows a screening of only 46 experiments (or combination of variables) coded between −1 and 1. The quadratic response surface model based on DA is built up using the above mentioned DOE based on 46 experiments in the space of 5 coded DV. Fig. 28
                         shows the approximated RSM calculated and given by the following quadratic metamodel:

The minimization of the resulting metamodel was carried out with two different algorithms, namely the VF02AD algorithm using the SQP method [31] and a second optimizer based on the simplex algorithm. Different initial points were used to minimize the OF, and the best result obtained after minimization corresponds to

After obtaining the optimal material fibers orientations, we carried out a last FE calculation using optimal solution

                        , where maximal stresses in all principal directions are compared to values obtained using the initial material data with 
                           θ

                        . As we can observe, the optimal fibers orientation, allow a reduction of the maximal stress distribution in the structure, we found also that the obtained results if physically good since the orientation of the material fibers follows the general orientation of the structure geometry.

In the present investigation, an efficient 8-node solid-shell element formulation for the analysis of multilayered composite shell is presented. While the ANS method has been used in order to remedy to shear locking, the enhancement of transverse normal strain is adopted, thus full 3D anisotropic constitutive model is incorporated without resorting to the plane-stress assumption. The present formulation can predict the through-thickness effects with a high degree of accuracy.

In the second part of the paper we proposed a specific method based on RSM for the optimization of laminated structures, where the design variables are the material fibers orientation. To solve the optimization problem, we proposed a technique which has the advantage of replacing a complex response model by an approximate model evaluated in a limited number of points obtained through an experimental design. In this study, we proposed a specific response surface method based on Diffuse Approximation involving pattern search optimization. The resulting response surface algorithm involves iterative improvement of the objective function employing locally supported nonlinear approximations.

Numerous applications have been treated, they confirmed that the optimization method based on RSM and DA coupled to the developed
