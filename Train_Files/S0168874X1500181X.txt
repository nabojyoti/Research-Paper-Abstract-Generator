                  This paper describes the development of a reduced model of a fastener using Multi-Connected Rigid Surfaces (MCRS). The stiffness of the connectors is determined, based on a physical approach, considering different deformation modes of the bolt. The reduced model is constructed and identified from a numerical simulation of a single lap reference joint under tensile load, with the adherent parts and bolts represented by 3-D solid elements. A single simulation with a given clearance, axial preload and friction coefficient is used to identify equivalent stiffnesses. The reduced model is then compared with the 3-D solid elements model in a two-fastener configuration for different values of clearance, preload and friction coefficient. The comparison covers overall response in terms of stiffness and load distribution between fasteners, local response in terms of stress fields and calculation times. Results show that the reduced model proposed here is able to reduce calculation times while still providing a good estimate of the mechanical quantities needed for the study and dimensioning of multi-fastener joints.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Because of the costs and delays incurred in experimental studies, numerical simulation is an essential tool when designing assembled structures. The design of fastened joints is based on making a good estimate of the distribution of loads between fasteners. This load distribution depends on the stiffness of the fastener, the stiffness of the parts, the way in which external forces are introduced, and also clearances and geometrical defects. Note that by stiffness of the fastener, we refer to the ratio of the load borne by the fastener to the relative displacement, one against the other, of the parts adjacent to the fastener. Depending on whether the load is transmitted by adherence or by fastener pin-hole contact, this stiffness will be very different. In the former case (load transmitted by adherence), the role of the axial preload is fundamental; in the latter case (load transmitted by contact), the presence of clearance results in contact occur gradually and hence stiffness evolves. For a composite structure joint, the two modes of load transfer combine since the material is unable to bear a high preload due to its low resistance in the out-of-plane direction. In addition, the materials in contact tend to be damaged as a result of bearing stresses, which also leads to a change in stiffness. Generally, with a single lap joint, the rotation of the parts caused by the secondary bending moment is directed by the bending stiffness of the fastener heads. This is an important phenomenon since it gives rise to a non-uniform distribution of contact pressure between the pin and the two holes.

The quantity and complexity of the phenomena involved lead us naturally to model the fastened joints using a refined mesh of 3-D solid elements. This type of model was developed in order to study the effect of the friction coefficient [1], clearance [2], location error [3] or preload [4]. As well as predicting load distribution between the fasteners, these models also provide accurate results for the stress fields in the high gradient regions around the hole. They are also known for their ability to take material non-linearities into account, such as damage [2,5,6]. Several modes of degradation can be introduced, such as delamination, matrix cracking or fibre failure. Despite these performances, models using 3-D solid elements are still very costly in terms of calculation time and they require specifically adapted calculation strategies, notably parallel computing by domain decomposition to process assemblies with several dozen fasteners or to carry out parametric studies on several hundred configurations [7,8].

Thus in order to deal with assemblies with a very large number of fasteners, or to carry out extensive parametric studies, analytical or semi-analytical models have been developed. The 1-D models proposed in the literature can predict load distribution between fasteners in a wide variety of configurations: bolted [3,9–12] or bolted/bonded [13], with clearance and location errors [3], taking into account loss of stiffness due to bearing damage [3,9,13,14]. However, these models are limited to one-dimensional plane geometries and loadings.

Several approaches have been developed in recent years to simplify the way fasteners are represented in finite element models. The first consists of representing each fastener by a special connection element, available in most finite element analysis software packages, which links a single node from each adherent part, potentially incorporating various non-linear behaviours [15–17]. In this case, the holes and the contacts are not represented. This is a very interesting approach in terms of calculation time, but it requires a specific identification procedure to include the role of clearance, friction and material non-linearities overall in the behaviour of the connector. Moreover, the stress field around the fasteners is not represented, and thus macroscopic failure criteria must be used for the assembled parts [18,19].

Gray et al. [20] have modelled the adherent part with shell elements and the bolts with two rigid cylindrical surfaces connected by a beam exhibiting elastic behaviour. The heads were replaced by coupling the movement of the beam ends with the adherent parts. The model is validated for a single lap joint with one bolt and three bolts, including clearance and preload. The problem with these approaches remains the identification of the equivalent stiffnesses associated with the connection elements. A simple estimate of shear stiffness can be made using various analytical models to be found in the literature [21,22], but the values obtained can vary by a factor of 1 to 5.

In this paper, a reduced model of a fastener using Multi-Connected Rigid Surfaces (MCRS) is proposed. The number of rigid surfaces and the stiffnesses introduced between them were selected by analysing deformation modes of the fastener in a single-lap configuration obtained from a reference model made up of 3-D solid elements. From this decomposition, 4 rigid surfaces and 4 stiffnesses were defined. The procedure for identifying these equivalent stiffnesses is also based on the 3-D reference model in a fixed configuration (clearance, friction coefficient, preload). The efficiency of the model was assessed on the basis of global criteria (at the scale of the joint) and local criteria (at the scale of the materials). The validity domain of the identification was studied by varying the clearance, friction coefficient and preload.

In this section, an analysis of deformation modes of the fastener is proposed and in particular the relative movement between the functional surfaces of the fastener. Studies referred to in the bibliography [1,3,21,23] show that deformations in the bolt can be decomposed into 4 main modes: tension and bending along the fastener pin axis, shearing of the pin and bearing–compression of the contact semi-cylinders. A finite element model where the fastener is represented by 3-D solid elements is proposed to extract quantitatively these different deformation modes. This analysis is used as a basis for building and identifying the reduced model.

The reference configuration used to study deformation modes in the fastener is a single lap joint made of aluminium/composite material with two bolts, as shown in 
                        Fig. 1. The composite material is a carbon fibre laminate with unidirectional ply and a thermoset matrix T700GC/M21. The stacking sequence for the composite adherent is [90/0/−45/+45/0]
                           s
                         and ply-thickness is 0.25mm. The second adherent part assembled is made of aluminium alloy 2024. The two steel bolts, diameter 6.35mm, are fixed with a radial clearance of 10µm and axial preload of 3500N generating an average contact pressure under the head of about 75MPa. All material properties are listed in 
                        Table 1.

The model created with Abaqus code uses 3-D solid elements with reduced integration (C3D8R). The threaded junction between the nut and the screw is not modelled. The bolt is therefore represented as a single part. The flexibility resulting from the threaded junction between the nut and bolt is therefore neglected in the reference model and hence in identifying stiffnesses in the MCRS model. According to the literature, this flexibility can be estimated analytically and thus incorporated afterwards into the MCRS model [23,24]. Preload is modelled by initial penetration of 15µm of each head into the adherent parts giving an intended axial preload of 3500N. A contact algorithm using the penalty method with a friction coefficient of 0.1 is also introduced to model contact between the bolts and the adherent parts. Deformation modes in the bolt are analysed with a tensile load of about 15kN, which corresponds to the initiation of bearing damage obtained experimentally.

A section S of a bolt is defined as a set of nodes having initially the same coordinate Z. To represent the kinematics of the bolt, for each section S, initially written S
                        0 with centre M
                        0, we define a least-squares plane P from actual position of the nodes of section S. In the event of uniaxial loading along

                        , plane P remains perpendicular to plane (XZ). An orthonormal coordinate system

                        Fig. 2. M is defined as the intersection of plane P and the curve representing the deflected shape of the bolt axis. For the centre section O (O being the intersection of the axis of the bolt in its deformed state and the overlap plane of the joint) the associated coordinate system is written

                              ,

In order to obtain a displacement field that can be exploited to analyse the different deformation modes in the bolt, a rigid body field displacement was subtracted from the calculated displacement field so that coordinate system

Specific points on the bolt are defined in plane (XZ) as shown in 
                        Fig. 3a. To take the deformation of the heads into account and to represent properly the movement of the functional surfaces that make up the surfaces under the head, the sections centred on A and B are divided into “Pin” section (exponent P) and “Head” section (exponent H) as shown in Fig. 3b.

                         and the deflected shape of the axis (AB) are therefore mainly the result of shear strain. 
                        Fig. 5 shows the deflected shape (AB) of the axis of the pin, also the deflected shape (CD) and (EF) of its two contact lines in the loading plane (XZ) which accumulate both shear and compression strains in the pin in areas of contact with the adherent parts.

The proportion of displacements caused by shear loading and bearing–compression depends for the most part on the geometry of the bolt. The shorter the bolt in relation to its diameter, the greater the compression strains in relation to shear strains. Note also that during transverse loading, the adherents are subjected to shear deformation due to tangential frictional forces in the overlap surface. If adherent material stiffnesses are lower than the fastener stiffness and bolt-hole clearance is low, contact can be established between the pin and adherents near the overlap plane before sliding. That point and the effects of bending in the adherent parts tend to concentrate the contact pressure near the overlap plane as shown in Fig. 5. Moreover, on comparing the deflected shape of (CD) and (EF) it can be seen that the orientation of the composite plies affects the regularity of the displacement field because of the variation in stiffness of the material adjacent to the contact.

Gray and McCarthy [20] modelled fasteners with two rigid surfaces connected by an elastic beam in order to account for shear and bending deformation. This model therefore overlooks the deformation induced by bearing–compression.

The purpose behind reducing the model is to do away with the 3-D elements of the bolt, which represent a large proportion of the number of degrees of freedom in the joint. The idea is to use a limited number of rigid surfaces to represent the functional surfaces of the bolt and connect them elastically. For the deformation mode generating a rotation located at the pin–head junctions, it is natural to propose a division along the planes passing through 
                           A
                         and 
                           B
                         accompanied by transverse rotational stiffness along 
                           
                              x
                              →

                              z

                         of the surfaces under the heads as a function of the normal load borne by the bolt along

                        . A single division associated with stiffness in translation is therefore proposed. The decision to place the division in the centre section

                         was an arbitrary one. Concerning shearing between the normal planes

                         and compression at the contact points, the aim of the model is to predict the relative transversal displacement of the section portions in contact as a function of the transverse forces along 
                           
                              x

                        . Normally, a model of this kind should be discretised along 
                           
                              z

                        . However, as the ultimate aim is to use the reduced model of the bolt with an adherent part model using continuum shell elements, it seems judicious to divide the pin into 2 cylindrical rigid surfaces

                         in order to maintain some coherence between the kinematics of the bolt model and that of the adherents. It is worth noting that since in the MCRS model, shear deformations, bearing–compression and bending deformations are gathered and concentrated in a single section (pin section which is in the overlap plane), the sliding of the pin section due to shear and associated rotations according to fastener axis are not explicitly represented, but only the global relative displacement of two contact surfaces. The geometry and the relative displacements permitted in the different parts of the MCRS are shown in 
                        Fig. 6a.

Stiffnesses and constraints are introduced into Abaqus by 2-node connector element with 3-D behaviour (CONN3D2). They enable the master nodes of each rigid surface to be linked and introduce stiffnesses according to certain degrees of freedom. As the bolt is axisymmetric, the same stiffnesses are used in directions 
                           
                              x

                        . Abaqus proposes a variety of usual links in its connector element library [25]. The connector C0 is an assembly of two connectors ALIGN and CARTESIAN. The ALIGN connector ensures that the directions of the local coordinate system for the two rigid surfaces remain parallel. The CARTESIAN connector defines 3 translational stiffnesses (

                         can be computed for each level of applied load. Numerical results show that during the sliding phase and clearance recovery, contact pressure under the bolt head is distributed uniformly. Once pin-hole contact is established, contact pressure under the head on the opposite side of pin-hole contact tends to increase because of the rotation of the heads, thus generating a greater strain on the heads. As a result, the equivalent tension stiffness K

@&#RESULTS AND DISCUSSION@&#

The purpose of this validation is to show that the MCRS model can be used both for predicting load distribution in a multi-fastener joint and also for predicting the stress state in assembled parts and thus apply adequate resistance criteria.

Validating the MCRS model is based on comparing global and local criteria with the 3-D model. To assess the domain of validity of the MCRS model, the comparison covers different configurations compliant with Fig. 1 where clearance, friction coefficient and preload have been modified. The different configurations tested are listed in 
                     Table 3. It should be remembered that only case no. 1 was used for the identification.

As shown in 
                        Fig. 9, at the scale of the overall structure, comparing the deflected shape of the joint gives good agreement in terms of bolt rotation and deviation of the adherent parts at the ends of the overlap region.


                        
                        Fig. 10 shows the force–displacement graphs for the 3-D and MCRS models in the different configurations tested. Results show a good level of prediction for the joint stiffness after the sliding phase and clearance recovery, whatever the value of the clearances. Sliding forces are underestimated by about 30% with the MCRS model, for all configurations. Indeed, as mentioned in Section 3.2, stiffness K
                        
                           n
                         depends on the load selected for the identification of the MCRS model. The deviation on sliding forces matches the relative gap between the equivalent tension stiffness K
                        
                           n
                         obtained with the 3-D finite element model for a load close to the sliding force (K
                        
                           n
                        =368kN/mm for a load of 1kN), and the load taken to identify the MCRS model (K
                        
                           n
                        =243kN/mm for a load of 15kN). Obtaining a better prediction of both sliding forces and final joint stiffness will require defining stiffness K
                        
                           n
                         which depends on the load applied to the considered fastener. Using stiffness identified with a fairly high load (15kN) explains why the sliding forces are under-estimated during the clearance compensation phase. We should remember, nevertheless, that for the composite parts, load transfer by friction remains low since the material cannot support a large preload as it has low resistance in the out-of-plane direction.

A graph of changes in loads transmitted by each bolt in configuration 2, where clearance differs for the two bolts, is shown in 
                        Fig. 11. The good agreement between the two models shows that the MCRS model estimates overall transverse stiffness of the bolt correctly and that it can be used in cases of multi-fastener joints.

The strength of the assembled parts is based on the distribution and amplitude of the stresses around the hole. Only the results for the composite adherent part are shown here. For composite materials, the model should correctly predict stress in the direction of the fibres under tension (failure initiation in net-section) and under compression (bearing damage initiation). Note that many studies [26–28] have shown that the failure of fibres under compression also depends on shear stresses and transverse stresses. Therefore, in order to assess the efficiency of the MCRS model at the scale of the material, it is vital to compare the field of the 6 components of the stress tensor at the edge of the hole in the ply coordinate system: direction 1 is the direction of the fibres, direction 2 is transverse direction in the stratification plane and direction 3 is transverse direction perpendicular to the stratification plane.

The comparison is made between the 3-D and MCRS models using configuration 1 with a load of 15kN. Results for the other configurations are similar. The images in 
                        Fig. 12a–g show the edge of the hole in the composite adherent part in contact with bolt 2. Results for bolt 1 are virtually identical. Note that the resultants for the forces transmitted by the pin of bolt 2 are very similar for the two models: 6864N for the 3-D model and 6934N for the MCRS (see results in Section 4.1). To facilitate analysis of the results, the contact pressure field is also drawn (Fig. 12a).

The pressure fields are fairly similar in appearance, however, the contact pressure is located closer to the overlap plane (Fig. 12a) for the MCRS model. This accounts for the deviations of about 25% observed for the maximum values of stresses linked directly with the pressure field (negative values of σ
                        11 and σ
                        22, positive and negative values of σ
                        12). The same deviations were noticed for the aluminium plate. The main explanation is that the flexibility of the pin in the 3-D model is more distributed than in the MCRS model, which generates a more spread contact pressure field whether the material used is layered composite or isotropic. However, whatever the FE model used, it is complicated to estimate correctly the stress field at the edge of the hole because of the high stress gradient in this area which generates high mesh sensitivity. Practically, in order to prevent mesh sensitivity and also introduce physical material characteristic length, failure criteria, especially for composite materials, are based on point stress or average stress approaches, with the result that we do not only use the stress field at the edge of the hole [29,30]. Results show that the gap between the MCRS model and the 3-D FE model tends to decrease quickly as soon as one moves away from hole edge. Even so, the use of local response of the MCRS model is thus promising for dealing with bearing failure.

The maximum tensile stress in the direction of the fibres (positive values of σ
                        11) is very well estimated by the MCRS model, and thus this model can be used to predict net-section failure.

First, it is worth noting that the objective with the proposed reduced model is to study joints with a large number of fasteners and to perform parametric studies by running tens or hundreds of calculations. For a given case defined by adherent materials and thicknesses, only one calculation with a two-bolt 3-D model has to be performed in order to identify equivalent connector stiffnesses. The calculation time using the reference 3-D model will be negligible compared to total calculation time.

Although the aim of this study was ultimately to use the MCRS bolt model with adherents modelled by shell elements, it is nevertheless interesting to evaluate the calculation time saved by simply replacing the 3-D elements of the bolt by the MCRS model.

Numerical simulations of the different models were carried out with an Abaqus/Standard implicit scheme using 4 cores of an Intel Xeon 16-cores 2GHz processor and 64GB RAM computer. With the MCRS model, the saving in total calculation time compared with the 3-D bolt model varies from 10% to 68% depending on configuration, as shown in 
                        Table 4. Reducing the number of degrees of freedom by using rigid analytical surfaces means that not only can the size of the stiffness matrix of the FE model be reduced but also the number of degrees of freedom involved in the contact algorithm. However, this last point may have a negative effect since by making the bolt rigid, resolving the contact law may become more difficult. As a result, the number of iterations per increment of load may increase. Thus although the average time saving per iteration is about 40%, the time saving overall is markedly less.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

This article describes a model of a fastener based on rigid surfaces connected elastically. The construction of the model is based on a reference finite element model made up entirely of solid 3-D elements. The method can be used to define the number, the position and the type of stiffness (translational or rotational) to introduce between these rigid surfaces based on analysis of the different deformation modes of fastener. Using this approach, it will be possible to make choices linked with physical phenomena and to understand the limitations associated with these choices. As identifying the stiffnesses associated with each deformation mode is partly dissociated and based only on stress and strain fields in bolt, it therefore results in a unique set of parameters, which are not much dependent on the behaviour of the assembled parts, contacts between parts and fastener and level of preload. This method therefore provides very satisfactory results not only for global stiffness and the distribution of loads between fasteners, but also for the local response assessed from contact pressure fields and stress fields.

With this reduced model of a fastener combined with a continuum shell elements model for the assembled parts, the number of degrees of freedom can be reduced by about 85%, a saving in calculation time of about 80% and it is possible to envisage accurate simulations of complex structures with hundreds of fasteners.

In addition, the fact that the true shape of the parts is explicitly represented with the holes means that failure criteria or non-linear laws resulting from plasticity or damage at the material scale can be applied directly, thus avoiding a stage of local re-analysis or the use of macroscopic criteria in a narrow validity domain.

Furthermore, the physical approach proposed to construct the reduced bolt model could be extended to different pin-based joining technologies. For a double-lap joint it seems appropriate to use 3 cylindrical rigid surfaces to represent a bolt pin. For a countersunk head bolt, a thorough re-analysis of deformation modes of the fastener will be required in order to define relevant rigid surface geometries and connector types.
