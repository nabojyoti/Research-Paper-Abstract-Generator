                  A new finite element model for steel–concrete side-plated beams exposed to mechanical and thermal loading is presented. The moisture and heat transfer through concrete is considered independent on mechanical deformations. The hygro-thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in two separate steps starting with the moisture and heat transfer analysis and continuing with the mechanical stress–strain analysis. The finite-element model of Davie, Pearce, and Bićanić was implemented for the moisture and heat transfer analysis in the concrete part of the beam. The Fourier equation of heat transfer for non-porous solids was applied in the steel part. A novel, strain-based finite-element formulation of the planar beam is proposed to perform the mechanical part of the fire analysis. Each of the two steps of the model is first verified by comparing the present numerical results with the experimental and numerical data available in the literature. The finite-element formulations of both the hygro-thermal and the mechanical steps of the analysis are found to be reliable and accurate. Finally, effects of the side reinforcing of a RC beam as one of the methods of structural retrofitting are explored in the case of a typical fire scenario and an important contribution of the side-plates to the ultimate fire resistance of the beam is discovered, particularly when higher levels of the service load are applied to the beam.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The plating technique is considered one of the peak engineering solutions of strengthening of flexural beams and is especially popular in design of structural retrofitting and renovation of buildings. Several different plating solutions have been presented over the course of the past few decades with the tension-face plating technique being accepted best among engineers. Because often mistakenly considered as less efficient, alternative side-plating techniques are only applied when the tension-face plates are not applicable due to structural or aesthetic reasons. The decisions in favour of the tension-face plates might reflect the current status of the scientific publications. Numerous reports on the behaviour of the tension-face plated beams (being the representatives of standard composite beams) have been published since the middle of the last century (e.g. [1–7]). In contrast the reports on the side-plated beams are rare. Our understanding of their behaviour under different types of loads is remaining to be poor. Regarding the behaviour of the side-plated beams at ambient temperature, an analytical model based on an assumption that the degree of the transverse partial interaction between the plate and the beam is a function of the difference between their curvatures, was first presented by Nguyen et al. [8]. In 2011 the first non-linear numerical method for the side-plated beams accounting for a bolted side plate/beam connection was presented by Siu and Su [9]. A similar, yet a more general numerical model accounting for different possible types of the contact connection was later on presented in [10]. The reports on experimental investigations of the side-plated beams at room temperature are rare as well [11,12]. The experiments as well as mathematical models of the side-plated beams subject to elevated temperatures are missing either.

In the analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) beams at high temperatures, complex numerical methods are unavoidable. The most simplified numerical approaches to obtain the temperature fields in concrete structures only consider the heat transfer as in a solid non-porous material. However, concrete is a highly heterogeneous material consisting of not only the stone aggregate and hardened cement paste but also of pores partially filled with water (free or chemically bound) and with the gaseous mixture of water vapour and dry air. Hence the heat is not only conducted but also convected through the material and always accompanied with a chemical decomposition and phase changes (water evaporation and the vapour liquefaction). These complex phenomena lift the level of energy dissipation and slow down the heat transfer. The simple thermal model where moisture in the material is not accounted for can, therefore, lead to an overprediction of temperatures [13], especially when concrete with a high initial content of moisture is considered or where water vapour cannot escape easily from the structure (e.g. in poorly permeable concrete beams or in the steel–concrete composite beams with the steel member acting as a vapour barrier). More complex models including the heat as well as the mass transfer in the material and their coupled interaction need to be considered instead.

The models accounting for heat as well as for the moisture transfer in concrete represent the so-called hygro-thermal models (e.g. [14–16]). These models adopt the assumption originally proposed by Bažant and Kaplan [17] that the volumetric compressibility of water and air phases in concrete is much higher than the volumetric compressibility of the hardened cement paste, so that the relative volume change of the pore space cannot produce significant changes in pressures in water or air, and the moisture and heat transfer through concrete in fire can be therefore considered independent of the mechanical deformation. For highly permeable normal strength concrete (NSC) structures such an assumption appears to be rather reasonable [18]. This is contrasted to the case of high strength concrete (HSC) structures which are, when rapidly heated, often subject to concrete spalling. The phenomenon of spalling is thought to be caused by the buildup of pore pressures during heating and is, in the HSC structures, most often a consequence of a low initial permeability of material. The latter is often additionally reduced due to high compressions evolved in the structure due to the service load and, in the case of a thermal exposure, by restrained thermal dilatation. It is believed that a full, coupled thermo-hygro-mechanical model must be applied to consider mechanical damage phenomena such as concrete spalling properly (e.g. [19–21]). In such models material properties, in particular the concrete permeability tensor, diffusion coefficients, and the material stiffness tensor need to be known with a high precision [18], if a reliable prediction of pore pressures is to be expected. Unfortunately, these characteristics are not understood and explored sufficiently well both for high and ambient temperature [18]. In lieu of such complex hydro-thermo-mechanical models, a few simple fracture models for spalling predictions that can be implemented in a hygro-thermal model have been proposed (e.g. [18,22,23]). In the models proposed in [18,22], the pore pressure in concrete is multiplied by a certain factor at every time step and then compared against the temperature-dependent tensile strength of concrete. Wherever the product is greater than the tensile strength, spalling of concrete should be considered. Advanced versions of some of such models account for the effects of the compressive zone due to the change of the permeability of the concrete caused by the service load (see [16]). Unfortunately, even these advanced fracture models cannot explicitly account for the thermal dilatations, which, in some cases, have a substantial additional effect on concrete spalling. Thus, the applicability of these improved models for different types of concrete and composite concrete structures as well as for different boundary conditions is yet to be explored.

In this paper a new numerical model for side-plated RC beams subject to mechanical and thermal loading is presented. The moisture and heat transfers through concrete under high temperatures are considered to be independent of mechanical deformations. Consequently, the hygro-thermo-mechanical analysis can be performed in two separate steps: (i) the hydro-thermal analysis resulting in the moisture and heat transfer data, and, based on the moisture and heat transfer results, (ii) the mechanical analysis resulting in stress and deformation data and the critical time. For the hygro-thermal analysis of the concrete part of the beam, the model of Davie et al. [15] is implemented. The mechanical analysis is based upon a planar beam model of Reissner [24] and the following assumptions are made: (i) the beam and the side plates have constant cross-sections and straight axes, (ii) the bond between the layers is flexible enough to allow for small slips (the longitudinal and the transversal ones) to occur at the side plate/beam contact, (iii) uplifting and the penetration of one layer against the other, e.g. due to the local buckling of the side plates, are neglected, (iv) the interaction between the layers is typically realized through a bonding layer of an infinitesimal thickness, which can be, hence, neglected in the model, and (vi) an additive split of strain into thermal and mechanical parts is assumed, where the creep strains including also secondary and transient creep are considered to have their own contributions. The final system of non-linear time-dependent differential equations of the first order is solved iteratively in space and time by a novel, strain-based Galerkin-type method of finite elements proposed by the authors. In the numerical examples that follow, we first verify the present numerical model and then continue to seek the advantages of the side-reinforcement of a normal strength concrete beam from the fire safety point of view.

Although the present model is primarily intended for the analyses of side-plated NSC beams, the paper concludes with a brief look into the effects of concrete spalling in a side-plated high strength concrete beam implementing a simple fracture rule of spalling proposed by Dwaikat and Kodur [16].


                     Section 2 aims to present the proposed new two-step numerical model for the thermo-hygro-mechanical analysis of concrete beams strengthened with side plates and subject to mechanical loads as well as to elevated temperatures such as in fire. Based on the given temperature regime in the surrounding compartment, the moisture, pore pressure, and temperature fields in the structure are obtained in the first step. The results are used as an input for the second step of the analysis, where the stress and strain fields in the beam due to the combined mechanical and thermal loads are determined. In the sequel the two steps are presented in detail.

Once the variation of the time-dependent gas temperature in the compartment surrounding the structure has been defined (for the fire analysis one of the parametric temperature–time curves such as the one proposed in [25] is typically assumed; or alternatively, a CFD model of a fire-driven gas flow is used), moisture and temperature within the steel and concrete are to be determined. The equation of the heat transfer in the non-porous homogeneous steel side plates is Fourier's equation of heat conduction. The transfer of temperatures, free water, and mixture of dry air and water vapour in concrete is obtained by the solution of the equations of a coupled heat and moisture transfer proposed by Davie et al. [15]. Their model considers evaporation of free water, liquefaction of water vapour and dehydration of the chemically bound water. In addition, the model also accounts for the capillary pressure and the part of the free water co-existing in an adsorbed state. In the sequel we review the basics of the model by Davie et al. [15].

The mathematical model of Davie et al. [15] comprises a system of mass conservation equations for each phase of concrete separately and the energy conservation equation as

                            is the solid saturation point, i.e. the upper limit of the hygroscopic moisture range and the maximum degree of saturation with the adsorbed water.

It can be concluded from Eqs. (7)–(9) that the free water mass flux is equal to the flux of the adsorbed water until the surface of the capillary pores is fully saturated. Only after the full saturation has been reached, the pressure driven flow of the liquid water is evoked and the two quantities are no longer equal. The conclusion is well in keeping with the assumption of Gawin et al. [26] who stated that moisture entering a dry sample of concrete will initially fill the gel pores and adhere to the surface of capillary pores as the adsorbed water up to a maximum value, and only then the remaining capillary pore space is filled with the liquid water.

In addition to having the gas, liquid, and capillary pressures, an average pressure of fluids in concrete pores is often desirable, especially, if an extreme pore pressure buildup and subsequent spalling of concrete is to be expected (i.e. for HSC beams). Here we adopt the model of the averaged pore pressure, P

                           , introduced in Davie et al. [15], which is defined according to Eq. (14). The model assumes that the adsorbed water applies no pressure, while simultaneously behaves as a part of the solid skeleton when considering the transfer of stress. Thus the effects of the liquid and gas pressures are weighted on a pro-rata basis according to their volume fractions:

The beam and the side-plates are attached one to another with point-wise connectors (e.g. bolts) or with an adhesive bonding layer of small thickness. As the connection is not perfectly rigid in either of the two cases, the longitudinal and the transversal slips between the side plate and the beam occur in the deformed state.

which exactly displacements are to be expected at elevated temperatures, both the side plates and the beam are modelled by the geometrically, non-linear exact planar beam theory of Reissner [24], which exactly accounts for large displacements, large rotations, and large strains. The shear strains are neglected in the analysis, which is a reasonable assumption for slender beams [27].

The general mathematical model (see Fig. 1) consists of the unplated parts (

The governing equations of the plated part of the model consist of kinematic, equilibrium and constitutive equations, each written separately for:

The subscript ‘
                              pore
                           ’, introduced in Eqs. (21) and (22), indicates the contributions of pore pressures to the total hydrostatic stress of the concrete beam, and the subscript ‘eff’ refers to the effective stress (the well-known Terzaghi's principle). For the normal strength concrete beams, the pore pressure contribution is generally very small [17] and can be neglected. After this simplification of the model has been made, the following constitutive equations hold true

In the sequel we only discuss in a more detail the contact parts of the traction vectors. Imagining displacements of two initially coincident particles,

                            (Fig. 1), we easily conclude that their positions with regard to the fixed coordinate system are different after the deformation of the structure has occurred. In the deformed configuration, the position vectors of the observed particles can be written as

(15)–(22), finally consists of 4 non-linear algebraic and 12 non-linear first-order differential equations. To obtain the solution the strain-based finite element method is employed as shortly described in the sequel. The details of the derivation can be found, for example, in [5,29].

The finite element method employed is based on the modified principle of virtual work with the strains as the only interpolated unknown functions of the problem. The remaining primary unknowns appear solely as boundary values in the functional

In the incoming subsections of the paper, the present formulation will be employed in the analyses of some characteristic practical examples of side-plated beams at elevated temperatures. Prior to performing practical analyses, we have to verify the proposed mathematical model. For the verification of the hygro-thermal part of the model, Khan's experiment [30] investigating a pore pressure buildup behaviour in the concrete wall of a reactor containment vessel at high temperatures is simulated and results are compared with the experimental data. The verification of the second, i.e. the mechanical part of the model, was only possible on the experiment of Su et al. [11] who observed the mechanical response of a simply supported side-plated RC beam at ambient temperature. The verification of the present numerical model at high temperatures was not possible because an appropriate scientific publication reporting on experimental investigations of the side-plated beams at elevated temperatures has not been available. Consequently, it was impossible to verify directly the effect of creep and transient strains in a plated beam which evolve only if temperatures are high. Yet similar types of structures have already been analysed elsewhere (see, for example, [31], where the principle of additivity of strains at elevated temperatures is validated by the experimental data for the fire-exposed centrically loaded reinforced concrete column of Lin et al. [32], or see [13], where the validation is made for the fire-exposed composite beam of Wainman and Kirby [33]).

In Section 3.2 we explore the effects of beam side reinforcing as a measure of retrofitting a beam damaged in fire. We carry out the fire analysis of a selected side-plated reinforced normal strength concrete (NSC) beam and compare the results with those of the fire analysis for the unstrengthened beam.

An analysis of a side-plated reinforced high strength concrete (HSC) beam is also carried out in Section 3.3 and a rough estimate of the mechanical effects of the pore pressure buildup and consequent spalling of the concrete member is made.

We find it convenient for the reader to collect some basic assumptions made in the examples to follow.

Referring to the thermal analyses, the following has been employed:
                        
                           •
                           It is assumed that the heat and moisture are transferred only over the cross-section thus neglecting small transfer in the third direction.

Since the area of the steel reinforcement in a RC beam cross-section is small compared to the concrete area, we neglect any effect of the steel bars on the distribution of temperature and moisture fields over the beam. This is done by replacing steel bars by concrete [34]. Once the temperatures in concrete have been obtained, the temperature of the bars is taken to be equal to the temperature of the concrete at the position of the reinforcement.

The symmetry was accounted for whenever possible. Therefore only one-half of the cross-section of the beam is employed in the hydro-thermal analyses with the assumption of the zero flow of moisture and heat across the symmetry plane (

It must be noted that some amount of moisture can escape from the RC beam around the edges of the plate. Because the escaping area is small compared to the whole contact area between the side plates and the beam, this effect is assumed to be negligible. In addition, prior to the bolted side plates are placed on the concrete beam, the vapour-tight epoxy grouts are injected into the gaps between the bolts and the bolt shaft (similarly as in [11]). Therefore, practically no moisture can escape through the bolt holes.

                              Since, as reported, the phenomenon of creep is excluded from this steel model, we follow the recommendations of Hozjan et al. [38] and include creep intensity as in Austen 135 steel using the model of Williams-Leir [39].

The model of Desayi and Krishnan [40] is used for the non-linear stress–strain relationship of concrete at ambient temperature (Section 3.1.2), because it allows for introducing a beneficial effect of the transverse reinforcement. Thus a beneficial spatial stress state is indirectly considered enabling a more ductile behaviour of concrete. In addition, the beneficial effect of the tensile strength of concrete is also incorporated with the use of the Bergan and Holand law [41] (Fig. 3b):

Following the instructions of EC2 [34] and the recommendations of Bratina et al. [42], we also add creep and transient strains of concrete, the former in accordance with Harmathy [43] and the latter as proposed by Anderberg and Thelandersson [44].

The contact constitutive laws used in the mechanical analyses at the ambient temperature were obtained from the load/deformation response of the ‘two-bolt’ connection in a standard bolt shear test performed by Su et al. [11] (Fig. 3d).

The contact law introduced in [45] for the use in the mechanical analyses at elevated temperatures is chosen (Fig. 3e). The maximal bearing capacity of a shear connector at room temperature is taken to be

When the side plates span into the compressive region of the RC beam, uplifting and penetration of one layer against the other, e.g. due to the local buckling of the side plates, can occur. These and other stability phenomena are not dealt with in this paper. Note, however, that the instability of the beam due to local buckling of the side plate could be easily observed from the linearized governing equations of the proposed model (for further details on the procedure observe [46]).

Each of the mechanical analyses presented in this paper employs the mesh consisting of 6 finite elements with 4 interpolation points and 4 Gaussian integration nodes along the element length. The integrations over the cross-sections use

In our first numerical example, we perform a hygro-thermal analysis of a cylindrical concrete specimen contained in a thick cylindrical steel tube sealed at both ends and heated at the top. With this analysis we simulate the experiment of Khan [30] representing an imitation of the thermal shock problem caused by an accident in the Fast Breeder Reactor, in which hot sodium coolant makes contact with the metal liner of the concrete containment vessel subject to sudden heating to 400°C. Our numerical results are compared with Khan's experimental data and the numerical results of Ichikawa and England [22].


                           Fig. 4
                            presents the relevant data of the problem. The numerical model presented in Fig. 4b consists of the concrete core and the steel wall. The concrete part is modelled by 2040 finite elements and 360 finite elements are used for the steel part. The thickness and thermal conductivity of the heated stainless steel diaphragm on top of the concrete cylinder and the thickness of the steel base beneath them are not given in [30]. Therefore, these two components of the specimen are not modelled explicitly. Instead, at each individual time step, their effects are simulated through the boundary conditions (see Fig. 4b). At the top, the corresponding measured (see Fig. 4c) temperature is applied directly to the upper edge of the model. In addition, no mass transfer is assumed through the upper edge of concrete in the model, since the diaphragm is expected to act as a vapour barrier. Due to a significant height of the concrete core and a low thermal conductivity of concrete, only a low amount of heat was transferred to the lower edge of the concrete cylinder during the experiment (observe, for example, experimental data presented in Fig. 6), therefore no mass and heat transfer is assumed through the lower edge of the model either. In addition, such an approximation seems reasonable also because the specimen was in experiment seated on a steel base plate and the surrounding (usually well-insulated) floor beneath it preventing significant amount of heat to be lost through the bottom surface of the cylinder in the longitudinal direction. The initial porosity of concrete is set to

The distributions of temperature over the concrete core–steel wall cross-section and the distributions of gas pressures and the water vapour content over the concrete part of the cross-section as predicted by the present two-dimensional numerical model at the observed times are shown in Fig. 5
                           . In order to present the dynamics of the processes evolving in the structure during heating as vividly as possible, the limits of each colorbar are set individually. In addition, there is a comparison between the simulated and the measured pore pressures in the concrete core of the specimen presented in Fig. 6
                           . One can observe that shortly after heating had started, the pore pressures highly increased with time locally, but became nearly uniform over the specimen in the later stages of the experiment. It is clear that the numerical results of Ichikawa and England as well as the present ones succeeded to model the evolution of pressure well, yielding almost no discrepancies with respect to the experimental results for the final observed time 113.65min. Although the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is somewhat less precise for the earlier stages of the experiment, the discrepancies are much smaller for the present model (Fig. 6a); this also holds true for the pressure development over time (Fig. 6b). As the present model is more complex, this conclusion has been expected. In fact, in the Ichikawa–England model [22] the full energy conservation equation is replaced by the simple Fourier heat transfer equation in its original form, which is, in principle, valid for the heat conduction in non-porous solid materials only. In addition, solely the flow of free water is considered in their model resulting in only two equations of the problem compared to four used in the present model. Furthermore, the simplified mathematical model of Ichikawa and England employed a one-dimensional model of length L=34cm with sealed hot (x=0cm) and cold surfaces (x=L), in which heat transfers through the concrete core only, thus neglecting transfer in the radial direction. To adapt the one-dimensional solution to the current two-dimensional problem, the authors [22] proposed a somewhat modified equation for thermal conductivity of concrete such that their numerical results approached the experimental data for the temperature as closely as possible. We thus may conclude that the differences between the two numerical results derive also from the different physical assumptions of the models.

Especially well reflected is the difference between the two models when observing the initial slopes of the pore pressure–temperature curves in Fig. 6b. Generally an overestimation of the pore pressures predicted by Ichikawa and England [22] at earlier times at the locations 1–3 (Fig. 4) is observed. This is believed to be due to an overprediction of temperatures in this region being a consequence of the fact that the effects of the convection flow inside the concrete material and phase changes are excluded from the energy conservation equation of Ichikawa and England's model; these play an important role at the earliest stages of heating when the evaporation of water and the outcoming energy dissipation is particularly rapid. Moreover, from Fig. 6a, an underestimation of the pore pressures calculated by Ichikawa and England in cooler regions can be observed for almost any time. In these regions the pressures are mainly increased due to an increased pressure of the gaseous mixture pushed there from the hottest regions of the concrete specimen; such an underestimation of Ichikawa and England's results could be anticipated, however, because the flow of the gaseous mixture is neglected in [22].

Our second numerical example is a simply supported RC beam externally strengthened with two symmetrically bolted side plates and subject to a two-point bending at room temperature (Fig. 7
                           ). This beam was tested experimentally by Su et al. [11] and later on also analysed computationally by Siu and Su [9]. Their results are used to verify the second, i.e. the mechanical part of the present numerical model. Results for two bolt arrangements are presented (Fig. 7). The corresponding cases are marked as ‘case a’ with a ‘5-bolts’ contact connection and ‘case b’ with a ‘3-bolts’ connection. In the analyses, the same material property data are used as reported by Su et al. [11] and Siu and Su [9].

The comparisons between the experimental and the computational results are shown in Figs. 8 and 9
                           
                           , where the present numerical results are confronted with the experiments of Su et al. [11] and the numerical results of Siu and Su [9]. The agreement between the load–deflection responses (Fig. 8) is very good in terms of both the stiffness and the ductility of the beams, in terms of the ultimate bearing capacities, and also in terms of the turning points in the ascending parts of the curves corresponding to the instants, when yielding of the bottom reinforcement takes place. Further, in the experiments the failure of beam ‘b’ was initiated by the fracture of the two bolts closest to the support, whereas for beam ‘a’ concrete crushing was observed first. These collapse mechanisms are also observed in the present numerical simulations.

The agreement between the present numerical results and the numerical simulations of Siu and Su [9] is also good. A somewhat bigger difference can only be observed for the case of the stronger beam ‘a’, where a somewhat smaller ductility and bearing capacity of the beam are predicted by Siu and Su. This seems to be due to the different material laws of concrete used in the two analyses. While Siu and Su assumed the concrete constitutive law had a constant stress in the post-peak region, the present numerical model adopted a law with a descending stress and considered the advantageous effect of the transversal reinforcement on the ductility of the beam. Furthermore, there is also a minor difference between both results in terms of the initial stiffness of the load–deflection curves reflecting the fact that the bearing capacity of concrete in tension was ignored in the numerical simulation of Siu and Su [9].

The longitudinal slip responses as functions of the midspan deflection of the observed beams are depicted in Fig. 9. Small quantitative differences are observed between the two numerical results and they both correctly reflect the distinctions between the bolt force/slip responses implemented in the models. Note that Siu and Su [9] assumed a simplified bi-linear relationship with a somewhat stiffer initial part and a more flexible final part of the curve, in contrast to the more precise model implemented in the present analysis following the actual experimentally measured shape of the bolt force–slip curve. In experiments, however, smaller slips at a given midspan deflection were obtained as a rule. As already suggested by Siu and Su [9], this may be due to the fact that the frictional resistance between the surfaces of the beam and the side plates was ignored in the numerical models.

Our third numerical example is a simply supported RC beam externally strengthened with two symmetrically bolted side plates exposed to mechanical and thermal loads simulating fire conditions. Fig. 10

The rate of pore pressures evolving in the concrete during fire is expected to be sufficiently small, so that its direct effects on the mechanical response in terms of its contribution to effective stress in concrete could be neglected. Moreover, spalling is also neglected, because the selected concrete has normal strength. Hence the two-step hygro-thermal and mechanical model as described in Section 2 should be accurate enough for the analysis.

For the side-plated beam, two different bolt arrangements are analysed employing 2 parallel rows of 8 bolts (case ‘a’) or 5 bolts (case ‘b’) at each side of the beam, as shown in Fig. 10. Inside each individual row, the bolts are placed uniformly along the length of the row. Finally, the mechanical responses of both side-plated beams in fire are compared to the response of the unstrengthened beam (case ‘c’). The frictional resistance between the surfaces of the beam and the side plates is in the numerical analyses neglected. The distributed contact surface load corresponding to one row of bolts is assumed to act over the rectangular area whose length is equal to the length of the row and its height equals to one-half of the height of the side-plate. The nominal values of the material data at the ambient temperature used in the analyses are: compressive strength of concrete

The distributions of the temperature, pore pressures and the water vapour content over the concrete part of the cross-section of the side-plated beams (cases ‘a’ and ‘b’) and over the cross-section of the unstrengthened beam (case ‘c’) at 10, 30, and 60min are shown in Fig. 11
                        . The effect of the side plate acting as a vapour barrier on pore pressures and water vapour content can here be well noticed. As a consequence of the plate preventing the vapour escaping from the structure, the high vapour content and high gas pressures are observed along the steel–concrete contact. A closer inspection of the diagrams of temperature fields evolved over the concrete cross-sections of the unstrengthened and strengthened beams reveals that the higher content of moisture is in the strengthened beam followed by the reduction of temperatures in concrete (observe the hottest regions of the cross-section). Therefore, the effects of moisture on the temperature development cannot always be neglected and are correctly accounted for in the present analysis.


                        Fig. 12
                         shows the increase of the midspan deflection with time for the three observed cases ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’ for two load levels, i.e. P=40kN and P=70kN, with P=40kN corresponding roughly to 50% of the load at which yielding of the bottom reinforcement occurs in the unstrengthened beam at ambient temperature, and with P=70kN corresponding roughly to 90% of this load. At both of the two levels, the bearing capacity in terms of the critical time of the strengthened beams is greater than that of the unstrengthened one. At the lower load level (Fig. 12a), the side-plated beams would collapse approximately 10min later than the unstrengthened one. When the load level is higher (Fig. 12b), the relative increase in the critical time of the beam is even bigger: while the unstrengthened beam would collapse already 23min after the fire starts, the strengthened ones would successfully survive fire almost two times longer. The increase in the bearing capacity of the beam after its strengthening is therefore here almost 100%. The mode of collapse of the strengthened and unstrengthened beams is, however, different. While the collapse of the unstrengthened beams would typically be caused by the substantial magnitude of creep deformations in its reinforcement bars, which eventually causes material instability of the concrete part of the composite cross-section in the form of a strain localization (i.e. concrete crushing) and fracture of the beam, the side-plated beams, if subject to the lower load level (i.e. P=40kN), will collapse due to a contact failure. Increasing the load level to P=70kN, the same fracture mechanism would be observed for the side-plated beam with the weaker contact connection (case ‘a’), whereas if the bolts are sufficiently strong – which is true in case ‘b’ – a material instability of the concrete part of the cross-section will be observed prior to the collapse. Note that in the numerical calculations, material instability of the concrete cross-section is detected whenever the diagonal coefficients (i.e. the tangent axial and bending stiffnesses of the concrete cross-section) or the determinant of the tangent constitutive matrix of the concrete cross-section becomes zero (for further details on the procedure consult [48,49]). Furthermore, the contact failure is detected whenever the slip between the RC layer and the steel layer exceeds the upper limit of

The comparison between the results for the side-plated beams ‘a’ and ‘b’ in Fig. 12 shows that the time variation of the midspan deflection of both beams are about the same. This does not hold generally however. If the capacity of bolts were sufficiently large to resist the contact failure, the composite beam could exploit the remaining strength of the RC beam. Only this way the bearing capacity of the reinforced concrete part of the beam would be fully exploited.

In our last numerical example, we take a brief look into the effects of concrete spalling on the mechanical behaviour of a side-plated reinforced high strength concrete (HSC) beam. The spalling of concrete is in this subsection assumed to be caused by a pore pressure buildup in a low permeable HSC member. We explore the behaviour in fire of a very similar beam as in Section 3.2, where only minor modifications of concrete properties and of the locations of the reinforcement bars are made. The aim of these modifications is to enhance the probability of concrete spalling to occur. To this end the initial vapour content in concrete is set to

Since the selected characteristics of concrete correspond to a high strength concrete, the rate of pore pressures evolving in concrete during fire is expected to be high, so that the risk of concrete spalling cannot be overlooked. Nonetheless, because in the present numerical model, the ‘mechanical’ and the ‘hygro-thermal’ analysis are uncoupled, spalling, in general, cannot be automatically detected and followed. Recently an empirical formula was proposed by Dwaikat and Kodur [16], by which the ‘mechanical’ effects can be included in the hygro-thermal model indirectly. According to the procedure proposed in [16], this can be achieved by accounting for gradients in the magnitude of the initial permeability of concrete along the height of the beam depending on the position of the neutral axis in the beam under service load as follows:

The proposal of Dwaikat and Kodur [16] will be applied in the numerical example. In order to assess their full effect on concrete spalling, the pore pressures are excluded from the mechanical analysis, although these effects might have some influence on stresses in this particular case. The current spalled area of the concrete cross-section is defined to be the set of all finite elements, in which the spalling criterion, Eq. (95), is met in all 4 Gaussian integration points of the element (Fig. 13
                        ). In addition, it is assumed that the side plates prevent the separation of the spalled concrete provided that the embedment length of the bolts is sufficient. Each time spalling takes place, the characteristics of the affected area of the cross-section change, so that the cross-section of the elements should be reshaped accordingly in the mechanical analysis. To avoid inconvenient reshaping, only a very small strength of concrete is assumed in the weakened area. A small value of strength is also assumed in the reinforcement bars, if the area of spalled concrete includes any reinforcement. This can indeed be observed at about 40min after the onset of the fire (Fig. 13).

The results of the mechanical analysis are presented in Fig. 14
                        , where the midspan deflection–time curves of the unspalled and the spalled beam are compared. The effects of concrete spalling are in this case obvious, as they represent roughly 20% loss of the ultimate bearing capacity of the structure. The structure also suffers from a substantial decrease in ductility and its time of collapse.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

A new finite-element model for steel–concrete side-plated beams exposed to mechanical and thermal loading has been presented. The moisture and heat transfer through concrete has been considered independent of the mechanical deformation. The hygro-thermo-mechanical analysis of the side-plated beam has been performed in two separate steps, of which the moisture and heat transfer analysis step has been performed first, followed by the mechanical analysis of stresses and deformations, based on the moisture and heat transfer results. The moisture and heat transfer during fire has been assumed to be governed by the finite element model of Davie et al. [15], while a novel, strain-based finite element formulation of the planar beam has been used in the mechanical analysis.

Each of the proposed steps of the model has been verified by the comparison of the present numerical results with experimental and numerical data available in the literature. The finite-element formulations of the hygro-thermal and the mechanical steps of the analysis have been proved to be appropriate for the analysis of side-plated beams as they are reliable and accurate.

The advantages of the beam side reinforcing as a possible method of structural retrofitting have been explored for an assumed fire scenario. An important contribution of the side-plates to the ultimate fire resistance of the RC beam has been discovered, especially when higher levels of the service load were applied on the beam.

In the last section, the effect of concrete spalling in a fire-exposed side-plated reinforced HSC beam has been explored as well. Because in the proposed numerical model, the mechanical and the hygro-thermal analyses are uncoupled, spalling, in general, could not be detected and followed automatically. This was resolved by adopting an empirical formula of Dwaikat and Kodur in the hygro-thermal analysis to account for the pressure effects indirectly. A substantial effect of spalling on the bearing capacity has been observed. In the simply supported HSC side-plated beam explored here, a roughly 20% loss of the ultimate bearing capacity along with a substantial decrease in ductility and the critical time has been found out. Future research will be addressed to the development of further models of concrete spalling in side-plated concrete beams.
