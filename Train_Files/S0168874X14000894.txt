                  The displacement-based finite element method (FEM) has become a method of choice for material nonlinear analysis of plates. For material nonlinear problems, the displacement-based FEM relies upon a step-by-step incremental approach and the repetitive computation of the systematic stiffness matrix. These shortcomings lead to the error accumulation and huge computational consumption, which encourage the reconsideration of force-based methods for elastoplastic problems. In this paper, a force-based Large Increment Method (LIM) is employed for the elastoplastic analysis of plates using a force-based 4-node quadrilateral plate element which is based on Mindlin–Reissner plate theory. The consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix of plate element is derived and implemented to solve elastoplastic plate problems. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the mesh convergence of the plate element by solving the linear elastic thin and moderately thick plate problems by comparing with the analytical solutions and displacement-based plate elements. Two simple elastoplastic plate problems are presented to illustrate the accuracy and the computational efficiency of LIM by comparing with the results from the FEM software ABAQUS.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Over the last few decades, the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) has been proved to be a highly powerful tool for analyzing a wide variety of physical problems in many areas of engineering. In these fields, two distinct finite element methods named the displacement-based FEM and the force-based FEM have been developed for analyzing very complicated nonlinear problems in structural mechanics and solid mechanics. In recent decades, the displacement-based FEM has dominated current practice for the numerical simulations of nonlinear analysis of structures due to its straightforward implementation and easy computer automation. However, many shortcomings of the FEM have been observed in the analysis of the material nonlinear problems and can be summarized as follows: (a) the error accumulation, which mainly comes from the step-by-step solution procedure, (b) huge computing time consumption, which is due to obtain accurate results with many small enough steps and an iterative algorithm to solve the nonlinear system of equations. At each step, the linearized constitutive relation may vary from the previous step, which will lead to a different system stiffness matrix. Consequently, the different system stiffness matrix has to be handled again and again during the step-by-step process, and (c) inaccuracy of stress, the stresses are calculated indirectly using the differentiation from the displacement, which may cause numerical errors in stress predictions. These shortcomings lead to the reconsideration of the force-based approaches for the material nonlinear problems. It is well known that, the main unknowns in the traditional force-based method are the redundant forces. However, this approach is not easy to implement in computer software because there are difficulties in the selection of the statically determinate structures and constructing the self-stress matrix, and an improper selection may lead to the programming difficulty and computational instability. A number of novel schemes have extended the force method for linear and nonlinear problems [1–5]. The main purpose of these researchers is to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional force-based method and the displacement-based FEM. By far, many force-based finite element methods still have to linearize the constitutive model and the error accumulation problem is not suppressed in essence.

As a novel iterative displacement-based method, the large time increment method (LATIN) is proposed for the material nonlinear problem by Ladevèze [6]. In recent years, the LATIN has been extended to solve many elastoplastic material [7,8], frictional contact [9], nonlinear multiscale [10] and parallel computing problems [11]. In LATIN, the governing equations are divided into two groups: the global equilibrium and compatibility equations, and the local constitutive equations. This method relies on a step-by-step solution process at the system analysis stage and nonlinear iterative procedure at the local stage using different search direction. It should firstly assume the material behavior to form the initial the system stiffness matrix for getting the initial solution, which can lead to error accumulation. The large increment method (LIM), which is first proposed by Zhang and Liu [4] for material nonlinear problem, is a novel iterative force-based FEM. In LIM, all the independent internal element forces are adopted as system unknowns and the basic determinate structure is no needed, so the LIM becomes a systematic method and it is easy to implement in the computer program. Like the LATIN, the governing equations of LIM are also divided into two groups: the global equilibrium and compatibility equations, and the local constitutive equations. In the case of small deformation, the linear equilibrium equations and the compatibility equations are treated in the global stage and are only solved one time, which will lead to less time consumption. The nonlinear constitutive relation is treated in the local element stage separately. By separating the governing equation into two stages, the constitutive model need not be linearized. Hence the step-by-step solution process is replaced by an overall iterative procedure, and the error accumulation can be avoided. In other words, the loading process often can be handled in one large increment for monotonic loading or a few large increments for cyclic loading. In recent years, LIM has been extended for solving elastic-perfectly plastic analysis of plane frame structures under monotonic and cyclic loading and 2D continuum elastoplastic problems [12–14]. The accuracy and efficiency of LIM have been proved. For the parallel computing in the time and spatial domain of LIM, it has great potential for solving large scale structural problems with significant computational saving [15].

In this paper, LIM is employed to analyze the elastic and elastoplastic plate problems using a force-based 4-node quadrilateral plate element (PQ2) [16]. Meanwhile, the consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix of plate element is derived and implemented to solve elastoplastic plate problems. The PQ2 element has no extra spurious energy modes and can avoid shear locking for solving the thin plate. Two linear elastic plate bending problems are presented to further illustrate the mesh convergence and accuracy of the PQ2 element. Two simple elastoplastic plate problems are presented to study the accuracy and the computational efficiency of LIM by comparing with the results from the FEM software ABAQUS. All the numerical results show that the performance of the LIM is as good as the commercial FEM software in linear elastic and elastoplastic problems.

The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, the basic equations of LIM for plate element is presented. The consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix is given in Section 3. In Section 4 we present the basic theory of LIM. Numerical examples are provided in Section 5 and some conclusions are stated in Section 6.

Only small deformation and small displacement are considered in this paper.

Unlike the traditional FEM, LIM does not have to decompose the spatial domain to obtain substructure and the governing equations are decoupled. For the reason, the constitutive equation can be dealt with on element level. In this case, while solving the constitutive equations, there is no data exchange among all the elements, therefore calculations could be parallelized in spatial domain.

For the indeterminate structures, the equilibrium matrix is non-square matrix in LIM. The generalized inverse matrix theory is employed to obtain the set of solutions of the non-square matrix equations directly. First the initial force is got and the constitutive equations are then utilized to obtain the element deformation. The deformation compatibility is used as the optimization objective, and the problem becomes an optimization problem. For solving the optimization problem, the conjugate gradient method is used to find the correct solution.

For the material nonlinear problems, the current level and the history records of stress and strain are used for the constitutive equations. Therefore, the loading history must be considered. Take some key sample points in the loading history function

The convergence and the shear locking phenomenon of the PQ2 have been verified by analyzing the clamped moderately thick plate under uniform load [16]. To further illustrate the accuracy and the mesh convergence of the plate element PQ2 for the linear elastic plate problems, two numerical examples are investigated by comparing with the analytical solution as well as the results of the commercial FEM software ABAQUS 6.10 in this section and the existing 4-node quadrilateral displacement-based plate elements, namely the Q4 element [20], the Q4-R element [21] and the RDKQM element [22]. Meanwhile, two simple material nonlinear plate problems are investigated to show the performance of LIM in solving the material nonlinear plate bending problems. The results are compared with the results of the commercial FEM software ABAQUS 6.10.

A square plate with clamped and simply supported boundary conditions subjected to a uniform load is analyzed. The non-dimensional parameters: the side length L=40, the thickness h=0.4 or 8, Young׳s modulus

                        . Due to symmetries both in the geometry and the loading, a quarter of the plate is analyzed with various mesh sizes. The 4×4 regular meshes for a quarter of the square plate model are shown in 
                        Fig. 3. The results of LIM are compared with the analytical solutions [23] and the results of the ABAQUS׳s quadrilateral shell element (S4R element) with through-the-thickness stress integration (with three integration points). The convergence of the plate element is shown in 
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Figs. 4–11.

From the Figs. 4–11, it is clear that the mesh convergence of the PQ2 element for solving the linear elastic plate bending problems is as good as the famous reduced integration quadrilateral shell element S4R and the Q4-R plate element. In most cases, the force-based quadrilateral PQ2 element gives more accurate stress resultant results than the S4R element, the Q4 element and RDKQM element with an increase in the number of elements.

A circular plate with simply supported conditions subjected to a uniform load. The non-dimensional parameters: the radius R=5, the thickness h=1 and 2.5 for the moderately thick plate, h=0.1 for the thin plate, Young׳s modulus E=10.92, Poisson׳s ratio

                         and the uniform load q=1. Due to symmetry of the plate, only a quarter of the plate which is discretized using 12 and 48 elements as shown in 
                        Fig. 12 is analyzed. The analytical solutions for the central deflection and the moment are obtained by Ayad and Rigolot [24].

In 
                        
                        Tables 1 and 2, the PQ2 element show weakly sensitive for the thin plate analysis. Meanwhile, the numerical results can converge to the analytical solution with an increase in the number of elements. The S4R element has six degrees of freedom for each node. Therefore, the PQ2 element has lower computation consumption than the S4R element. The force-based quadrilateral PQ2 element gives more accurate stress resultant and deflection results than the Q4 element with an increase in the number of elements.

The S4R element has more degrees of freedom than the PQ2 element, so the PQ2 element has lower computation consumption than the S4R element. Clearly speaking, ABAQUS has to construct governing equations for the whole system and solve them for 24 times. However, LIM just need to repeat the optimization part which is shown as Step 2 in Fig. 2 for 11 times. It clearly proves the efficiency of LIM in dealing with the elastoplastic problem. For the monotonic loading case, LIM can reach a solution in one large increment or in a few large steps, and can also eliminate the cumulative errors. Meanwhile, the calculation in the loading steps can be implemented simultaneously because of its independence on other each step.

As we known, the S4R element has more degrees of freedom than the PQ2 element, so the S4R element has more computation consumption than the PQ2 element. It is clear that ABAQUS has to construct governing equations for the whole system and solve them for 43 times. However, LIM just need to repeat the optimization part which is shown as Step 2 in Fig. 2 for 13 times. It clearly proves the efficiency of LIM in dealing with the elastoplastic problem. For the cyclic loading case, LIM can reach the solution in a few large steps, and also can eliminate the cumulative errors. Meanwhile, the calculation in the loading steps can be implemented using pipelined parallel computation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents an extension of LIM for solving the elastic and elastoplastic plate problems and the consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix of the plate element is derived. The convergence and accuracy of the PQ2 element are also illustrated by the numerical examples of the linear elastic plate problems. The accuracy and efficiency of LIM to solve material nonlinear problems are shown by the monotonic and cyclic loading analysis cases. The numerical results show a very good comparison with the FEM results and LIM can serve as an alternative method to displacement-based FEM.

For the material nonlinear problems, the parallel computation in LIM could be executed both in spatial domain and time domain in theory. The LIM has great potential for solving the material nonlinear problems with significant computational savings by using parallel computation. This will be a valuable topic as a separate work in the future research.
