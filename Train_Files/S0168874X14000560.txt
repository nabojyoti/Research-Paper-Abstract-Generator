                  This paper presents an efficient formulation of the problem of wave propagation along the length of axisymmetric pipes under non-axisymmetric loading such as leaks or new cracks so that wave characteristics in a pipe can be identified without the excessive computational time associated with most current 3D modeling techniques. The axisymmetric geometry of the pipe is simplified by reducing the problem to 2D while the non-axisymmetric loading is represented by the summation of Fourier series. Since the pipe stiffness matrix as conventionally formulated represents the greatest single computational load, the strain–displacement matrix is partitioned in such a way that numerical integration components are decoupled from θ (the angular parameter) and n (the number of Fourier terms). A single numerical integration of the strain–displacement matrix is performed and utilized for all the iterations of Fourier terms to represent the non-axisymmetric load. The numerical formulation is conducted using spectral elements, which also reduce computational time since these elements yield a diagonal mass matrix. The computational efficiency of the developed method is compared with conventional finite element tools.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The main wave propagation based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) methods for pipelines are guided wave ultrasonics and acoustic emission. Guided wave ultrasonics relies on capturing the reflected wave energy from a defect after introducing a perturbation signal using ultrasonic transducers [1,2]. If less-dispersive guided modes are selected to transmit and receive the signal, long-range pipes can be monitored using a limited set of transducers. The acoustic emission (AE) method relies on propagating elastic waves emitted from newly formed damage surfaces such as active cracks and leaks. Crack growth causes sudden stress–strain change in its vicinity, which generates a wideband step function. A leak causes turbulence at its location, which generates continuous emissions. The AE method may be based on elastic waves propagating through the pipe material [3,4] or acoustic waves propagating through the material inside the pipe [5]. For an effective and accurate monitoring approach, wave characteristics such as the dispersion curves under buried or fluid filled conditions and the attenuation profile should be known prior to the implementation of an SHM method. However, experimental simulations of different pipe geometries and conditions are generally not possible. Wave propagation in pipes is a complex phenomenon due to the excitation of multi-mode waves, which must be superimposed to provide an overall solution. Analytical solutions of governing differential equations are not applicable when the pipe geometry becomes complex with the presence of defects, coatings and internal materials [6,7], buried conditions [8], and pipe bends [9]. The modeling of wave propagation is important for quantitative understanding of damage mechanics and the identification of the SHM system characteristics (e.g. frequency selection, sensor position [10]).

Wave propagation in pipes can be numerically modeled as 2D or 3D [11]. The 3D wave propagation problems of hollow circular cylinders including non-axisymmetric wave modes are formulated by Gazis [12]. If the problem requires modeling high frequency waves in a large-scale structure, the 3D model becomes computationally expensive. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce the mathematical problem to 2D or implement semi-analytical finite element formulation [13,14] for reducing the computational load. When the structure and loading are axisymmetric, the structural model can be reduced to a 2D problem as displacements and stresses are independent of θ (the angular parameter). There are several other methods for reducing the computational time of high frequency wave propagation in hollow structures. Benmeddour et al. [15] developed a three dimensional hybrid method which combined a classical FE method and normal mode expansion technique in order to study the interaction of guided waves with non-axisymmetric cracks in cylinders. Zhou et al. [16] utilized the numerical eigenmode extraction method applicable to wave propagation in periodic structures. Mazzotti et al. [17] applied a Semi Analytical Finite Element (SAFE) method to study the influence of prestressing load on the dispersion of viscoelastic pressurized pipe. Bai et al. [14] constructed an elastodynamic steady-state Green׳s function based on modal data determined from the spectral decomposition of a circular laminated piezoelectric cylinder using semi-analytical finite element formulation. Zhuang et al. [13] proposed integral transform and forced vibration as two different methods both based on the same set of eigenvalue data to construct a steady-state Green׳s function for laminated circular cylinder. Gsell et al. [18] discretized the displacement equations directly using the finite difference method, which reduced the computational time by 25%.

When the structure is axisymmetric and the load is non-axisymmetric, three displacement components in the radial, axial and circumferential directions exist [19,20]. To utilize the 2D axisymmetric geometry of the pipe, the non-axisymmetric load can be expanded using Fourier series, and the structural response can be computed by superposing the solutions of each Fourier term [21,22]. There are several examples in the literature related to applying Fourier series summation to model axisymmetric geometries with non-axisymmetric loading such as Zhuang et al. [13], Bai et al. [14],Wunderlich et al. [23] and Bouzid et al. [24]. However, in case where the Fourier expansion of the load function requires many harmonics to represent the non-axisymmetric loads such as concentrated loads, the 2D superposition method combined with conventional finite element formulation may not be computationally efficient than 3D analyses [25,26]. Bathe [25] describes that the stiffness matrices corresponding to the different harmonics can be decoupled due to the orthogonal properties of trigonometric functions. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study that explicitly presents the mathematical formulation. While numerical models are capable of simulating various pipe geometries and conditions to deduce the waveform characteristics, existing numerical formulations for wave propagation are computationally expensive, and not practical for modeling long-range pipes.

In this paper, a detailed mathematical formulation is presented to model axisymmetric geometries with non-axisymmetric dynamic loads, specifically concentrated loads. The formulation is based on partitioning the strain–displacement matrix in such a way that the numerical integration terms are decoupled from the variables θ and n (the number of Fourier terms). Therefore, the strain–displacement matrix is calculated only once and used for each Fourier term calculation. Additionally, the numerical formulation is built using spectral elements, which are special forms of finite elements that yield a diagonal mass matrix and thereby provide highly efficient numerical models for high frequency wave propagation [27,28,29]. The nodal coordinates of the Lagrange shape functions are obtained from the solutions of orthogonal polynomials. Moreover, one could optimize the computational expenditure by expanding the displacement field in the pipe over a series of normal modes.

The organization of this article is as follows: the discretization, spectral element formulation and the non-axisymmetric loading formulation are described in Section 2. In Section 3, the 2D numerical results are compared with 3D finite element models. The computational efficiency of the 2D model is presented in Section 4. Finally, the major outcome of this study and future work are summarized in Section 5.

For the spectral element formulation, the discrete locations of the nodal coordinates are defined by the Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre (GLL) points using the selected Legendre polynomial degree, which defines the p refinement within the element. The GLL points are calculated by the roots of the following equation [30]:

                        Fig. 1 shows the Lagrangian shape function using GLL integration points for (ξ,η). The non-uniform distribution of nodal points reduces the presence of Runge phenomenon [32].

The cylindrical coordinates and the axis of revolution for pipe geometry are shown in 
                        Fig. 2(a). The axial, radial and circumferential displacements are defined as w, u and v, respectively. The spectral element discretization of a cross sectional element using the 5th order Legendre polynomial is shown in Fig. 2b. The axis of revolution is z with the displacement component w.

In general, when loading has no symmetry and is defined by Fourier series components, the displacement components at radial (u, axial (w and circumferential (v) directions can be defined in the form of Fourier expansion as [24]

                        where n is the harmonic number. Single and double barred terms represent the symmetric and antisymmetric displacement amplitudes with respect to the plane θ=0 [24].

If the applied load is symmetric about the plane θ=0 and n=1,2,3…, the terms of the single-barred series represent the displacement amplitudes, and double-barred components vanish. The double-barred terms are associated with additional antisymmetric loads. For instance, the n=0 terms of the double-barred series are used to represent a pure torque [24]. However, for an isotropic elastic material, symmetric and antisymmetric terms are completely uncoupled and can be handled separately. In the case of antisymmetric harmonics, the stiffness matrix is identical to the symmetric case, which explains the appearance of negative sign in Eq. (4). Therefore, all the formulations are almost the same as symmetric case [18,24]. For the case of point loading at the circumference of the pipe, shown in 
                        Fig. 3, loading becomes symmetric about the θ=0 axis, and the displacement components are simplified as

In order to calculate the structural response, one may compute the stiffness matrix for each Fourier harmonic of loading as 
                           B
                         is functions of n and θ, and possibly different for each component of the total load. Therefore, superposition method becomes computationally expensive particularly in the case of the concentrated load, which requires many harmonics.

                           B
                         matrix is partitioned into two blocks

                        22 are independent of n and θ; therefore, they are computed only once for each Fourier iteration. This property of the stiffness matrix significantly reduces the computational time of large structural problems when many terms of the Fourier series are summed to represent the applied load.

The explicit time integration method requires less computational time as compared to the implicit methods [25]. The diagonal mass matrix obtained from the spectral element formulation allows the use of the explicit method. The stable time step is typically recommended as 1/(20f) where f is the maximum frequency of interest. In this study, the time step is set as 1/(25f) to reduce the influence of time integration to the output waveforms. As the spectral element formulation yields to diagonal mass matrix, reducing the time step does not influence the computational time significantly. In order to find the computational efficiency of the numerical formulation in comparison with commercial finite element (FEM) software, Newmark׳s method with unconditionally stable condition (i.e., average acceleration) is implemented to solve the numerical time integration.

A 3D circular cylinder pipe shown in 
                     Fig. 4(a) is modeled using conventional FEM tools in order to validate the numerical formulation. The pipe dimensions are 20mm thickness, 50mm radius and 500mm length. The 3D geometry is meshed with the resolution of 1/20th of the wavelength using the wave velocity as 3200ms−1. The 2D geometry, shown in Fig. 4(b), is divided into square elements using 4th degree Legendre polynomial. The material properties are 200GPa for Young׳s Modulus, 7850kgm−3 for density and 0.33 for Poisson׳s ratio. The comparison is performed using static point load and dynamic three-cycle sinusoidal point load with 10kHz frequency applied at the edge of the pipe. The other end of the pipe is modeled as the fixed boundary condition. The boundaries along the internal and external walls of the pipe are considered as air/solid/air.

The displacement history at the edge of the pipe obtained from the 2D formulation is compared with the result obtained from 3D model using COMSOL software in 
                     Fig. 5. The results of both models match well.

To validate the numerical formulation under dynamic point load, the displacement histories of the 2D model using presented numerical formulation and the 3D model are compared for three different points along the pipe line as shown in 
                     Fig. 6.

The displacement histories in radial and axial directions at the loading point for the 2D model and 3D model using COMSOL software are shown in 
                     Fig. 7a. Both models agree in time domain and frequency domain Fig. 7b indicates the peak frequency close to 10kHz peak frequency, similar to the excitation frequency.

In addition to COMSOL software, the 3D model is solved using ANSYS program as an additional benchmark study. Both programs have different input variables, such as element type, solver method, which influence the output waveform. Element types and time integration methods for COMSOL and ANSYS are summarized in 
                     Table 1. The element types of COMSOL and 2D models are tethrahedral, and spectral element, respectively. For ANSYS, there are two options: Solid285 (lower order 3D element with four nodes having four degrees of freedoms at each node) and Solid187 (higher-order 3D element having ten nodes and three degrees of freedom at each node). The comparison of ANSYS, COMSOL and 2D model shows that Solid187 results in better agreement with the 2D model and the 3D COMSOL model. While the time integration method of ANSYS and 2D model are the same as Newmark׳s method, COMSOL has options as generalized alpha and backward differential formulation (BDF). The generalized alpha method is an implicit method, which intends to increase the numerical damping without having effect on the order of accuracy. The BDF method is an implicit multi-step variable-order derivatives method, which is up to the fifth order due to the absolute stability region. As undamped models are not simulated properly with BDF method, the generalized alpha method is selected in this study. The generalized alpha has a variable as high frequency amplification factor in the range of 0–1. In this study, the high frequency amplification factor is varied until the COMSOL result fits well with the ANSYS result.

The comparison of the axial displacement histories using the 2D and 3D models at the point 1 is shown in 
                     Fig. 8. Although a good agreement is found between the 2D and 3D ANSYS and COMSOL models, especially the arrival time, magnitude and shape of the first wave cycle, there are slight differences after the second cycle. The differences in element types and time integration methods are considered as the main reasons of slight differences in the solutions of three models. It is worth mentioning that the 2D result relies on the expansion of Fourier series of delta function in the θ direction which is known as non-convergent; therefore the concentrated load was replaced by narrow rectangular pulse with an intensity of (2r
                     0
                     θ
                     0)−1 over the distance 2r
                     0
                     θ
                     0 where the 2θ
                     0 is a length of small arc [13].

The comparison of the 2D and 3D models is extended to the radial displacement of further point than the excitation location (i.e., the mid-point), and the result is shown in 
                     Fig. 9. The 2D model agrees well with the 3D models. The static and dynamic loading results validate the accuracy of the 2D axisymmetric model for non-axisymmetric loading using spectral elements and the method of partitioning of strain–displacement matrix. In next section, efficiency of implementing 2D model formulated in this study is discussed.

There are two fundamental sources that influence the computational time efficiency of the numerical model: extracting mass and stiffness matrices using numerical techniques and performing numerical time integration. The computational time efficiency of the 2D model is controlled by reduction in degrees of freedoms to calculate stiffness and mass matrices, decoupling θ (the angular parameter) and n (the number of Fourier terms) from strain–displacement matrix and diagonal mass matrix that enhances numerical time integration.

The degrees of freedoms (dofs) needed for the 2D and 3D (COMSOL) models to reach 10kHz frequency resolution are 600 and 30885, respectively. There is significant reduction in the dofs when the axisymmetric geometry is taken into consideration, and the spectral element is selected to model the structural domain. The difference between the 2D and 3D models increases dramatically when the required frequency resolution is increased. It is difficult to separate the computational time of the 3D model for the numerical calculations of the mass and stiffness matrices, and the time integration. However, the comparison of overall computational times of the 2D and 3D models shows the efficiency of the 2D model developed in this paper. For instance, the difference in the computational time in the 2D model is about 400s when the frequency is increased from 10kHz to 20kHz while it is 3000s for FEM. It is recorded that while reducing the time step does not influence the computational time of the spectral element the computational time increases for the classical finite element formulation.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presents an efficient formulation of the problem of wave propagation along the length of axisymmetric pipes under non-axisymmetric loading. The axisymmetric geometry of the pipe is simplified by reducing the problem to 2D while the non-axisymmetric loading is represented by the summation of Fourier series. The strain–displacement matrix is partitioned in such a way that numerical integration components are decoupled from θ (the angular parameter) and n (the Fourier series terms). The numerical formulation is built using spectral elements. The orthogonal Legendre polynomials are selected to define the nodal points of the discretized finite element. The 2D numerical model is compared with the 3D model using conventional finite element software, and the accuracy of the 2D model is validated under static and dynamic loading. Because of the numerical integration elements of the stiffness matrix as independent from θ and n, and the diagonal mass matrix resulting from the use of spectral elements, long pipes could be modeled for high frequency wave propagation. As future work of this study, the numerical formulation will be further optimized in terms of computational expenditure by using a mixed finite element modal solution.
