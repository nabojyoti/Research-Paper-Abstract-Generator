                  The two-dimensional dynamic analysis of the coupling system of fluid and heterogeneous structure is investigated by using an efficient multiscale computational method. The macroscopic equations of the coupling system are deduced. The liquid pressure-based and solid displacement-based coarse elements are employed for the numerical simulation. In addition, the piecewise oscillating boundary condition and the Lagrange polynomial boundary condition are used to construct the displacement base function of the solid coarse element and the pressure base function of the liquid coarse element, respectively. Furthermore, the generalized mode base functions are introduced into the multiscale base functions of both the fluid and structure coarse elements to capture the dynamic effect of the coarse element and improve the computational accuracy effectively. The predictor–corrector scheme is applied to solve the macroscopic transient response equation of the coupling system. Finally, several numerical examples are carried out to verify the validity and high efficiency of the proposed multiscale method by comparison with the fine-scale reference solutions.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

As well known, the composite materials are widely applied in the engineering practice due to their various advantages, such as high stiffness, high damping and corrosion resistant, which usually have multiple length scales [1]. Generally speaking, for these heterogeneous materials, the microscopic scale (material level) is usually far less than the macroscopic scale (structure level). The grids must be refined to make their sizes less than the microscopic scale when simulating the mechanical behavior of the heterogeneous materials by using the direct methods, such as the finite element method (FEM) and the finite difference method (FDM). Then, the mesh will be very large, and this will consume large amounts of computational resources. In this context, various multiscale computational methods, which can not only save the computational resources but also ensure the calculation accuracy, have been developed in recent decades, such as the asymptotic homogenization method [2–9] and the representative volume element (RVE) method [10–15]. However, these methods are usually limited to the problems with periodic microstructures. Recently, E et al. proposed a heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) [16–18] and provided a general framework to design the multiscale methods. For the elliptic problem, this method can be implemented on the macroscopic scale with some undetermined parameters which can be obtained by solving the elliptic problem on the sub-domain with special boundary condition. Then the microscopic heterogeneities in the sub-domain will be brought to the macroscopic scale. Finally, the original multiscale problems can be solved on the macroscopic scale. The multiscale eigenelement method (MEM) was developed by Xing et al. [19,20], which is efficient and easy to implement. It has been used for the static and dynamic analyses [20]. The multiscale finite element method (MsFEM) was developed by Hou et al. [21,22] to solve the second-order elliptic boundary value problem with high oscillating coefficients. To deal with the multiscale problems in the solid mechanics, a coupling multiscale finite element method (CMsFEM) was proposed by Zhang et al. [23] for the consolidation analysis of heterogeneous saturated porous media. Furthermore, an extended multiscale finite element method (EMsFEM) was also proposed by Zhang et al. for the elastic and elasto-plastic analyses of heterogeneous materials [24]. In EMsFEM, the multiscale base functions are numerically constructed by solving the static equilibrium equation on the sub-domain (unit cell) and these functions can capture the microscopic heterogeneities effectively. The additional coupling terms are introduced into the multiscale base functions to consider the Poisson effect among different directions, and then the computational accuracy can be improved significantly. Besides, a new multiscale method was developed for dynamic and adaptive analyses of heterogeneous materials [25,26] based on the EMsFEM.

However, there are few literatures to investigate the fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problem with the multiscale computational method. For the FSI problem, the dynamic characteristics of the structure due to external excitation will be strongly influenced by the interaction between the flexible structure and the fluid. The hydrodynamic pressure will be generated due to the fluid motion which is induced by the vibration of the structure. In turn, the hydrodynamic pressure will also change the vibration of the structure. The importance of FSI problem in engineering has attracted the attention of the researchers over the years [27–30]. Muller [27] showed that the compressibility of the liquid can affect the eigenvalues of the structure. Zienkiewicz and Bettes [28] presented two general approaches (Lagrangian and Eulerian) to deal with the FSI problem. Liu and Ma [29] developed a coupled fluid–structure finite element method for the seismic analysis of liquid-filled system of various geometries with and without internal components. Mitra and Sinhamahapatra [30] investigated the FSI problem by using fluid elements and structure line elements.

In the coupled fluid–structure system, the materials of the structure are usually heterogeneous. Then, if one employs the traditional directly methods (such as FEM and FDM) to investigate the FSI analysis, a large number of computational resources will be cost due to the multiscale features of the structure. Thus, seeking for an efficient multiscale computational method is meaningful for the FSI problem. In this paper, the dynamic analysis of the coupling system of fluid and heterogeneous structure is investigated with an efficient multiscale computational method. Three kinds of microstructures which are contained in the structure are taken into consideration, i.e., homogeneous, periodic heterogeneous and non-periodic heterogeneous microstructures.

This paper is organized as follows. The mathematical formulations of the coupling system and the developed multiscale computational method are introduced briefly in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. In Section 4, the macroscopic equivalent equations of the coupling system are deduced with the proposed multiscale method. In addition, the macroscopic equivalent matrices of the fluid domain and the heterogeneous solid domain are evaluated. Time integration of the macroscopic equations is achieved by employing the predictor–corrector scheme of the Newmark algorithm in Section 5. The dynamic analysis of the coupling system and some numerical examples are provided in Section 6. Finally, some conclusions are given in Section 7.

Generally speaking, it is convenient to classify the fluid–structure system into two categories according to the properties of the coupling system. The first class contains the problems in which coupling occurs on domain interfaces via the boundary conditions imposed there. The other contains the problems in which the various domains overlap (totally or partially) such as the seepage problem. In this paper, only the first category is taken into consideration and we have assumed

                                       ρ

                               of the fluid varies by a small amount only so may be considered constant;

that velocities of the fluid are small enough for convective effects to be omitted;

that viscous effects by which deviatoric stresses are introduced can be neglected in the fluid.

The equation described above is referring to the fine-scale model. For the multiscale problems, the size of the macroscopic scale is usually much larger than the size of the microscopic scale. A meaningful solution can be obtained by using the standard FEM on the fine-scale mesh where the size of the element must be smaller than the finest scale. Even this is not feasible due to that it needs a large number of computational resources. While for the proposed multiscale method in the following sections, the heterogeneous properties of the microscopic scale can be captured effectively by the multiscale numerical base functions. Thus the size of the mesh for proposed method can be larger than the size of the finest scale. Therefore, the original problems can be solved only at the macroscopic scale and this will save the computational resources greatly.

                     , is shown in 
                     Fig. 2. For the heterogeneous structure, the size of the macroscopic scale is usually much larger than the size of the microscopic scale. For the traditional finite element method (FEM), a meaningful solution can be obtained on the fine-scale mesh where the size of the element

                      must be much smaller than the finest scale 
                        ε
                     , i.e., 
                        
                           
                              h

                     . Sometime, this is even not feasible in that it needs massive computation cost. However, for the EMsFEM, the material heterogeneity at the microscopic level can be captured effectively by the multiscale numerical base function. Thus the size of the mesh 
                        
                           
                              h
                           
                           
                              c
                           
                        
                      for the EMsFEM can be much larger than the size of the finest scale, i.e., 
                        
                           
                              h
                           
                           
                              c
                           
                        
                        ⪢
                        ε
                     . Finally, the original problem can be solved directly on the macroscopic scale which saves the computation cost greatly.

The main idea of the EMsFEM is to construct the multiscale base function numerically on the sub-domain (unit cell). The numerical base function can bring the microscopic material heterogeneities into the macroscopic level. Thus, it can be seen as a bridge between the macroscopic and microscopic scales, which means that the construction of the base function is the key work in EMsFEM [23–25].

For the static problem, the multiscale base function can be obtained by solving the static equilibrium equation on the sub-grids. For the dynamic problem, it includes two parts: the displacement base function and the mode base function. The first part is determined by solving the static equilibrium equation and the second one is obtained by calculating the generalized eigenvalue problem on the sub-grids. The multiscale numerical base function can capture the heterogeneities of the materials within the unit cell effectively and efficiently. Then, the macroscopic equivalent matrices of the coarse element can be obtained by virtue of the multiscale numerical base function. Finally, the original multiscale problem can be solved only on the macroscopic scale, which can reduce the computational cost significantly.

Consider a 2D structure with heterogeneous materials which occupies a region 
                        Ω
                      and has a boundary 
                        Γ
                      depicted in 
                     Fig. 3. There are two sets of meshes. One is the coarse-scale mesh (thick grids) on the macroscopic scale for the macroscopic computation and another is the fine-scale mesh (thin grids) on the microscopic scale for the microscopic computation. For simulating the more complex deformation, a coarse element with more than four macroscopic nodes was presented in our previous work [25,26]. One can see that each multi-node coarse element has four boundaries and there are more than or equal to two macroscopic nodes on each boundary. The nodes on the coarse-scale mesh are regarded as macroscopic nodes and the nodes on the fine-scale mesh are considered as microscopic nodes.

For the fluid–structure system, the equation of solid domain usually takes the structural displacement (u) as the basic variable. For the fluid domain, the equation is always expressed in term of the hydrodynamic pressure (p) of the liquid. This is known as the displacement–pressure (u–p) formulation of the fluid–structure system. For the standard finite element method, the discrete coupled equations [27–30] on the fine-scale mesh are given as

                      are the interpolation function matrices of the structure and fluid elements on the fine-scale mesh, respectively.

For the coupling system of fluid and heterogeneous structure, the multiscale numerical base functions of the fluid and solid domains should be constructed separately. Then the macroscopic equivalent matrices of the fluid and solid coarse elements can be obtained by virtue of these base functions naturally. Finally, the macroscopic coupled equations can be deduced easily and the original problem can be solved on the macroscopic scale effectively.

A multi-node coarse element and its corresponding sub-grids are shown in 
                        Fig. 4. For the dynamic analysis of heterogeneous structure, the construction approach of the multiscale base function of the multi-node coarse element has been introduced in Ref. [25] in detail. In order to take the dynamic effect of the unit cell into consideration, mode base function is added to the multiscale base function. Then, the multiscale base function consists of two parts, i.e., the displacement base function and the mode base function. Finally, the relationship between the microscopic displacement and the macroscopic variable can be expressed as

As mentioned above, the displacement base functions of the multi-node coarse element are generated by solving the static equilibrium equation and the mode base functions are constructed by calculating the generalized eigenvalue problem on the sub-domain, respectively (see Ref. [25]). The piecewise oscillating boundary condition is applied to construct the displacement base function. As an illustration, the displacement base function of a multi-node coarse element is shown in 
                        Fig. 5, where

                         is the numerical interpolation function in the x direction of node i of the multi-node solid coarse element.

Similarly, we can also construct the multiscale base function numerically for the fluid domain. The fluid multiscale base function also includes two parts, i.e., the pressure base function and the pressure-based mode base function. For the fluid field, the construction approach of the multiscale base function is slightly different with that of the solid field. Since the fluid can be seen as a kind of homogeneous material and there is no oscillation at the boundaries of the coarse element, it is not necessary to use the oversampling technology and the piecewise oscillating boundary condition to construct the pressure base function.

Due to the homogeneity of the fluid, the pressure base function can be constructed by solving the pressure-based static equation with the Lagrange polynomial boundary condition on the sub-domain. Assuming that there are

                         are imposed on the first and fourth boundaries of the multi-node coarse element as shown in Fig. 4, respectively. The pressures on the second and third boundaries are set to zeros (see Fig. 6). Then, the pressure base function of macroscopic node 1 can be obtained by solving the equation

                         represents the number of the macroscopic nodes of the multi-node coarse element.

From Eq. (19), one can see that there is no the additional coupling term in the fluid multiscale base function for the scalar field problem. The pressure base functions of macroscopic nodes 1 and 2 are shown in 
                        Fig. 7.

Besides, the pressure-based mode base function can also be obtained by solving the equation on the sub-domain, i.e.

It can be found that the numbers of the macroscopic nodes of the multi-node solid and fluid coarse elements can be different according to the above derivation processes. After obtaining the macroscopic equivalent matrices of the multi-node solid and fluid coarse elements, the global matrices of the coupling system on the coarse-scale mesh can be assembled. Finally, the macroscopic equation of the coupling system of fluid and heterogeneous structure can be written as

                           fs
                         represents the number of the fluid coarse elements which are adjacent to the solid domain. Once the macroscopic equations of the coupling system are obtained, the original problem can be solved only at the macroscopic level and this will save a large number of computational resources.

For the time integration, the predictor–corrector scheme based on the Newmark algorithm is employed for the macroscopic coupled equations. The scheme for the solid field can be expressed as

Generally speaking, there are two approaches for solving Eqs. (46) and (47). One is the synchronized approach and the other is the staggered iterative approach. These two approaches are introduced as follows.

For the synchronized approach,

In this section, some numerical examples are carried out to verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed multiscale computational method for the coupling system of fluid and heterogeneous structure by comparison with the reference solution, which is obtained by the standard finite element method (FEM) on the fine-scale mesh. In the following examples, ‘EMs’ and ‘FEM’ represent the multiscale and reference solutions, respectively. Besides, it should be mentioned that the selections of the numbers of the macroscopic nodes and internal modes of the multi-node coarse element are dependent on our previous work (see Refs. [25,26]). In order to void repetition, only one kind of multi-node coarse element is employed in this paper.

If the fluid is incompressible and the surface gravity waves are not taken into consideration, the mass matrix of a single fine-scale element (see Eq. (13)) will be equal to zero, i.e.,

                           Example 1
                           The coupling system of the fluid and heterogeneous structure as shown in 
                              Fig. 8 is investigated. In this example, we will study the effects of the incompressible fluid on the dynamic characteristics of the structure. The sizes of the computational model are as follows, H
                              
                                 s
                              =3.84m, H
                              
                                 f
                              =3.2m, L
                              
                                 s
                              =0.64m and L
                              
                                 f
                              =2.56m. In addition, the coarse-scale mesh is shown in 
                              Fig. 9a and b, where each coarse element includes 16×16 sub-grids (see Fig. 9c). For the fine-scale mesh, the number of the fine solid elements is 64×384×2, while that of the fine fluid elements is 256×320. From our previous work [25], one can see that the computational accuracy will be improved significantly by increasing the numbers of the macroscopic nodes and internal modes of the multi-node coarse element. Thus, the 16-node coarse element (see Fig. 9d) is employed for the solid and fluid domains. Moreover, the first five displacement-based modes of the sub-grids are included in the displacement-based mode base function of the solid coarse element. Since the fluid is incompressible in this example, the pressure-based mode base function is not taken into consideration. Plane strain is considered for the structure. The heterogeneous structure with three kinds of unit cells is investigated as shown in 
                              Fig. 10, where unit cell (a) denotes the homogeneous material with the elastic modulus E=20GPa, unit cell (b) represents the periodic two-phase material with E
                              1=10GPa and E
                              2=20GPa, and unit cell (c) means the random heterogeneous material with E=10–20GPa. The densities of the fluid and solid are 1000kg/m3 and 2400kg/m3, respectively. Poisson׳s ratio of the structure is 0.3.

The first 100 frequencies are calculated in this example. In order to facilitate comparison, only the 50–100 order frequencies are displayed in the figures. In these solutions, ‘Dry structure’ represents the structure without the fluid and ‘Structure+Fluid’ means the structure with the incompressible fluid. For the structure with unit cell (a), the comparison of the frequencies between the multiscale solution and the reference solution is shown in 
                        Fig. 11, from which one can see that these two solutions are almost completely overlap. This indicates that the proposed multiscale method is feasible and has a high computational accuracy. The relative errors of the 100th order frequency for the cases ‘Dry structure’ and ‘Structure+Fluid’ are only 0.23% and 0.27%, respectively. For the structure with the periodic two-phase material, the frequencies are depicted in 
                        Fig. 12, from which the same conclusion can be drawn. The relative errors are only 0.17% and 0.21% for the cases ‘Dry structure’ and ‘Structure+Fluid’, respectively. In addition, the same conclusion can be achieved for the structure with the random heterogeneous unit cell (c) as shown in 
                        Fig. 13. The relative error is 0.24% for the case ‘Dry structure’, 0.29% for ‘Structure+Fluid’. Besides, one can find that the frequencies of the case ‘Dry structure’ are usually smaller than them of the case ‘Structure+Fluid’ from Figs. 11–13. These indicate that the fluid can hinder the deformation of the structure and these hindering effects are different for different modes. The total numbers of degrees of freedom (DOFs) for ‘FEM’ and ‘EMs’ are 100,100 and 4100, respectively. Furthermore, it takes about 2350s for ‘FEM’, while only about 56s for ‘EMs’. Approximately 96% of the DOFs and 98% of the CPU time are saved in this example for the proposed multiscale method by comparison with the reference solution. One can imagine that more computational resources can be saved for more complex engineering problems.

If the structure is considered as rigid and fixed (i.e., 
                           U
                           ≡
                           0
                        ), then the macroscopic coupled equation (Eq. (43)) will degenerate into the sloshing equation of the fluid, i.e.

                        where the external load is not taken into consideration.
                           Example 2
                           The sloshing analysis of the fluid is carried out for the computational model shown in Fig. 8. The coarse-scale mesh for the fluid domain is depicted in Fig. 9b. The structure is seen as rigid and fixed. The linearied surface wave condition is considered in this example. In order to simulate the wave characteristics of the free surface of the fluid more accurately, the microscopic nodes on the free surface are all treated as the macroscopic nodes, i.e., there are more macroscopic nodes for the coarse elements on the free surface of the fluid. The coarse element on the free surface and the coarse element in the fluid domain are shown in 
                              Fig. 14. The mechanical parameters are the following: density of the fluid ρ
                              
                                 f
                              =1000kg/m3, gravity acceleration g=9.8m/s2, and sound velocity in the liquid c=1414.2m/s.

The convergence plot for the solid domain has been given in our previous work [25]. In order to study the convergence of this proposed method for the fluid domain, we investigate the relative error of the 400th frequency when increasing the number of the pressure-based modes of the sub-grids of the fluid domain. The convergence plot is shown in 
                        Fig. 15, in which the relative errors are 8.22%, 0.35% and 0.030% for N=0, N=3 and N=20, respectively. Obviously, the number of the pressure-based modes has a great impact on the computational accuracy. Thus, to reduce the relative errors, it is necessary to take the pressure-based mode base function into consideration. In this example, the first 3 pressure-based modes of the sub-grids are considered in the pressure-based mode base function of the fluid domain for the multiscale computation.

For comparison, the first 400 order frequencies are calculated in this example. All the lower frequencies (i.e., the vibrations only occur on the free surface) are shown in 
                        Fig. 16, from which one can see that the multiscale solution and the reference solution are almost completely overlap. This indicates that the multiscale method can capture the vibrations efficiently in the lower order frequency domain. The relative error of the 257th order frequency is only about 0.08%. In addition, the comparisons of the higher order frequencies (i.e., the vibrations only occur in the fluid domain) are shown in 
                        Fig. 17 and the relative error of the 400th order frequency is about 0.3%. Moreover, the total numbers of DOFs for ‘FEM’ and ‘EMs’ are 82,497 and 3605, respectively. It takes about 567s for ‘FEM’, while only 22s for ‘EMs’. As we can see from these calculation data, about 96% of the DOFs and CPU time are saved in this example. This shows once again that this proposed multiscale method has high efficiency.

In this subsection, the transient response problem of the coupling system (see Fig. 8) subjected to the base excitation in the horizontal direction is taken into consideration.

For the Case I, the comparison of the displacements in the horizontal direction of Points A, B, C and D is shown in 
                        Fig. 20, from which one can see that the multiscale solution is almost the same with the reference solution. Besides, the same phenomenon can be seen in 
                        
                        Figs. 21 and 22. These figures indicate that the proposed method can provide high-precision calculation result. It should be mentioned that the multiscale base function is constructed only once for the system with periodic unit cell. This will save a lot of computation resources. For this case, the total numbers of DOFs for ‘FEM’ and ‘EMs’ are 182,597 and 7705, respectively. In addition, it takes about 715s for ‘FEM’, while only 32s for ‘EMs’. Approximately 96% of the DOFs and CPU time are saved in this case.

For the Case II, the completely random heterogeneous structure and the seismic excitation are taken into consideration. The displacement response of Point A in the horizontal direction is shown in 
                        Fig. 23, from which it can be observed that the responses obtained by FEM and the proposed method are extremely the same. In order to compare with the reference solution more clearly, the displacement response of Point A in the horizontal direction between the time interval (23–24s) are depicted in 
                        Fig. 24. Moreover, these phenomena can also be observed in the acceleration responses of Point A in the horizontal direction as shown in 
                        
                        Figs. 25 and 26. Furthermore, the slosh height responses of Point E for ‘FEM’ and ‘EMs’ are also almost the same as shown in 
                        Fig. 27. All these results illustrate that the proposed method has an extremely high computational accuracy. For the non-periodic heterogeneous structure, the multiscale base function must be constructed once for each coarse element. This may slightly reduce the computational efficiency. Fortunately, the multiscale base function is only calculated in the sub-domain. Thus, on the whole, the proposed multiscale method still has higher computational efficiency than the traditional finite element method. In this case, the total numbers of DOFs for ‘FEM’ and ‘EMs’ are still 182,597 and 7705, respectively. It takes about 17,942s for ‘FEM’, while only about 2058s for ‘EMs’. Approximately 96% of the DOFs and 89% of the CPU time are saved. It should be noted that more computing resources will be saved for the more complex engineering problems.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper, the dynamic analysis of the coupling system of the fluid and heterogeneous structure is investigated by using an efficient multiscale method. The displacement–pressure multiscale computation formulation is developed for the two-scale model. First of all, the main ideas of this proposed method are introduced briefly. Then, the construction approaches of the multiscale base function of the coarse element are also described in detail for the solid and fluid domains. The piecewise oscillating boundary condition and the Lagrange polynomial boundary condition are used to construct the displacement and pressure base functions of the multi-node solid and fluid coarse elements, respectively. To consider the dynamic effect of the unit cell, the displacement-based and pressure-based mode base functions are added into the multiscale base functions of the solid and fluid coarse elements, respectively. Besides, the macroscopic coupled equation of the system is deduced for the coarse-scale mesh. The time integration scheme of the macroscopic coupled equation is also provided in detail.

Finally, three kinds of numerical examples are carried out to verify the validity and efficiency of the proposed multiscale method. One can see that this multiscale method can be used for simulating the interaction problem of the fluid and heterogeneous structure successfully. Moreover, this proposed method also has high computational efficiency. In this paper, this multiscale method saves about more than 90% of the DOFs and CPU time by comparison with the reference solution. For more complex practical engineering problem, more computation resource will be saved. It should be mentioned that the parallel computing can be easily implemented in this multiscale method because of the independence between each coarse element.
