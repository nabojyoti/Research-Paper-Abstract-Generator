                  This paper considers the computation of eigensolution sensitivity of viscously damped eigensystems with distinct and repeated eigenvalues. To simplify the computation, a combined normalization, which combines two traditional normalizations, is presented. Based on the combined normalization, a method for sensitivity analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is studied. In the case of distinct eigenvalues, the proposed method can determine the eigenvector derivatives directly and is robust since the components of coefficient matrices are all of the same order of magnitude. The computational cost of the second-order sensitivities of eigenvectors can be reduced remarkably since the matrix decomposition of the coefficient matrix is available from the computation process of the first-order eigensensitivities. In the case of repeated eigenvalues, an algorithm is presented for computing the eigensolution sensitivities. The algorithm maintains N-space without using state-space equations such that the computational cost is reduced. The method is accurate, compact, numerically stable and easy to be implemented. Finally, three numerical examples have demonstrated the validity of the proposed method. The capacity of predicting the changes of eigensolutions with respect to the changes of design parameters in terms of the first- and second-order eigensensitivities is studied with application to the analysis of a two-stage floating raft isolation system.
               
            

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Design sensitivity analysis of engineering structures deals with the computations of the rate of performance measure from changes in the design parameters describing the structure. A significant body of research has been devoted to the computation and application of design sensitivity analysis (see, e.g., van Keulen et al. [1], Adelman and Haftka [2], Haftka et al. [3], Haug et al. [4] or Choi and Kim [5] or Chen [6]). Computational methods for design sensitivity analysis have received much attention over the past four decades, particularly those related to the eigenvalue problems. The eigensolution sensitivities of structural and mechanical systems with respect to structural design parameters have become an integral part of many engineering design methodologies including structural design optimization, structural health monitoring, structural reliability, dynamic model updating, structural dynamic modification, approximate reanalysis techniques and many other applications. Although computing eigenvalue sensitivity is straightforward, finding eigenvector derivatives raises several challenges, due in part to the singularity problem and repeated eigenvalues.

The modal method [7,8] evaluated the derivative of each eigenvector as a linear combination of the whole eigenvectors. Adhikari [9,10] and Adhikari and Friswell [11] derived N-space modal methods of viscously damped systems without using 2N-space (state-space) formulation where N is the system dimension. Although these 2N-space methods are exact in nature, the 2N-space approach usually needs heavy computational cost for real-life multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) systems due to the size of system matrices of state-space equations is double. Adhikari [12] first extended the modal method to the more general symmetric and asymmetric systems with nonviscous (viscoelastic) damping. To guarantee the accuracy of the derivative of each eigenvector, the modal method needs a linear combination of all the eigenvectors, which is a significant computational task. Often only the lower order frequencies and associated mode shapes are calculated. That is, approximated sensitivity may be evaluated depending on the number of modal terms. Corrections to the model truncation problem have been investigated by several authors [6,13–17].

Fox and Kapoor [7] also suggested a direct algebraic method, which calculates the eigensolution derivatives by assembling the derivatives of eigenproblems and the additional constraints obtained from the derivative of normalization condition into a linear system of algebraic equations. Garg [18], Rudisill [19], Rudisill and Chu [20] investigated the algebraic method to address the problem of asymmetric eigensystems. Lee and Jung [21,22] derived an algebraic method with symmetric coefficient matrices to solve the eigensolution derivatives. But these methods [18–22] are only restricted to the first-order representation of the equation of motion. Later, Lee et al. [23,24] further extended their algebraic method to symmetric systems with viscous damping. Choi et al. [25] developed their method for the second- and higher-order derivatives of eigensolutions for symmetric systems with viscous damping. Unfortunately, Wu et al. [26] pointed out that these methods [22,24,25] were not correct since a mistake was made in the computation of derivatives of the normalization condition for the eigensystems with repeated eigenvalues. Choi et al. [27], Guedria et al. [28], Chouchane et al. [29] and Xu et al. [30] further extended the algebraic method to compute the eigensolution sensitivities of asymmetric viscously damped systems. Recently, Li et al. [31] extended the algebraic method to the more general nonviscous damped systems. Li et al. [32] developed an algebraic method for asymmetric nonviscously damped systems, which can evaluate the sensitivities of eigenvalues and eigenvectors without using the left eigenvalues.

Another efficient method proposed by Nelson [33] finds the eigenvector derivatives with distinct eigenvalues for undamped eigensystems by expressing the derivative of each eigenvector as a linear combination of a particular solution and a homogeneous solution of the singularity problem. The particular solution can be found by identifying the element of the corresponding eigenvector with the largest absolute value and constraining its derivative to zero. It is worth mentioning that each eigenvector can always satisfy the singularity problem and is therefore considered as a homogeneous solution of its derivative. The arbitrary constraining the derivative of the largest absolute value can be compensated by the computation of the coefficient of the homogeneous solution. Sutter et al. [34] pointed out Nelson's method is more efficient than the modal method for the reason that the modal method needs all or most of the eigenvectors to find the eigenvector derivatives. Friswell [35] developed Nelson's method to compute the second- and higher-order eigensolution derivatives for undamped systems. Later, Friswell and Adhikari [36] extended Nelson's method to viscously damped systems. Guedria et al. [37] extended Nelson's method to second-order derivatives of eigensolutions of viscously damped systems. Recently, Adhikari and Friswell [38] extended Nelson's method to nonviscously damped systems. More recently, Omenzetter [39] extended Nelson's method to general nonlinear eigensystems. Although Nelson's method mentioned above gives exact results and only needs the eigenpairs of interest, these methods are clumsy for programming.

Jankovic [40] gave the exact analytical solutions for the first- and higher-order derivatives of eigensolutions of linear and nonlinear eigenproblems. Murthy and Haftka [41] surveyed the methods for sensitivity analysis of the eigenproblem with general non-Hermitian matrices. Mottershead et al. [42] pointed out that the eigensensitivity-based method is probably the most successful approach to model updating. Other methods have been developed for the calculation of the sensitivity of mode shape including the iterative method [43,44], QR-based method [45,46], Davidson-based method [47], the combination method [48], the finite difference method [49,50] and the substructuring method [51–53].

The methods [7–53] to compute eigensensitivity are only restricted to the case of distinct eigenvalues. Choi and Kim [5] pointed out that repeated eigenvalues are far more likely to happen in optimized structures. Thompson and Hunt [54] paid attention to optimal designs that are constructed with repeated eigenvalues. Olhoff and Rasmussen [55] showed that a repeated buckling load may occur in an optimized clamped-clamped column. Ojalvo [56], Mills-Curran [57], Dailey [58] developed Nelson's method for solving the derivatives of eigensolutions of undamped eigensystems with repeated eigenvalues. Methods [56–58] are based on deleting rows and columns of the singular system to form a reduced coefficient matrix. Unfortunately, the methods [56,58] may fail in some circumstances (see Mills-Curran [59] for details). Shaw and Jayasuriya [60] generalized the methods [56–58] to compute the eigensolution derivatives in the case of repeated eigenvalues with repeated first-order derivatives. Tang et al. [61,62] investigated the eigensolution derivatives of general asymmetric systems with repeated eigenvalues. Later, Xu and Wu [63] presented a new normalization and developed a method for the computation of eigensolution derivatives of asymmetric viscously damped systems with distinct and repeated eigenvalues. More recently, Li et al. [64] suggested a new normalization for the left eigenvectors, from which the left and right eigenvector derivatives can be computed separately and independently for asymmetric viscously damped systems with distinct and repeated eigenvalues. Li et al. [65] showed the undamped, viscously or nonviscously damped eigenproblems can be considered as a degenerated case of general nonlinear eigenproblems and developed a unified eigensensitivity method for both distinct and repeated eigenvalues. However, most of the existing methods to obtain the derivatives of the complex eigensolutions with repeated eigenvalues employ first-order (2N-space) formulation.

In this study, the symmetric eigenproblems with viscous damping is considered. To simplify the computation of eigensolution derivatives, a new combined normalization, which combines two traditional normalizations, is presented. The aim of this paper is to propose a compact method to calculate eigenvector derivatives directly by constructing the coefficient of the homogeneous solution to be zero in the case of distinct eigenvalues. In the case of repeated eigenvalues, an N-space algorithm is presented for computing the eigensolution sensitivity such that it is easy to be implemented and need lower computational cost.

The paper is concerned with the derivatives of eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors at p=p
                     0, and hereafter “p
                     0” is omitted for variables evaluated at p=p
                     0. The eigensolutions of viscously damped symmetric systems and the derivatives of system matrices (the mass, damping and stiffness matrices) are assumed to be known. For convenience, the following notation is adopted

Eigensensitivity analysis for viscously damped systems has received much attention over the past two decades. However, previous works have focused primarily on eigenvectors normalized by Eq. (2) alone. Alternatively, one can choose other kinds of normalizations, e.g.

                     . Following the procedures of Nelson's method [36] by using normalization (6), it is easy to verify that the eigenvector derivatives can be determined directly due to the fact that the coefficient of the homogeneous solution is equal to zero. Caution must be exercised here, the eigenvalue sensitivities must be evaluated from Eq. (4), and the compact formula (5) does not hold.

This section proposes a new normalization which attempts to determine the eigenvector sensitivities directly and holds the compact formula (5) of the eigenvalue sensitivities. For p=p
                        0, we assume the new normalization is same with the traditional normalization Eq. (2). To express it clearly, we give the form

                        The normalization is usually presumed to be a differentiable function, at least in the neighborhood of the current design point, i.e., the point at p near p
                        0. Here we suggest that the new normalization satisfies the following form for p near p

                        It means that the largest element in absolute value on each eigenvector is a constant for p near p
                        0. When p=p
                        0, normalization Eq. (8) is always satisfied, and normalization Eq. (7) can be imposed to guarantee the unique solutions of eigenvectors at p=p
                        0. So the combined normalization is consistent. Compared to the traditional normalization Eq. (2), the combined normalization not only preserves the compact formula of eigenvalue sensitivities expressed by Eq. (5), but also determines the eigenvector derivatives directly (the details can be seen in the following subsections).

For structural optimization, optimal solution usually need be obtained by calculating the derivatives many times. If the combined normalization is used, the eigenvectors should be renormalized at the beginning of each iteration, which seems to be clumsy for programming. However, it is clear that the complexity of implementation and the computational effort of renormalization are less than those of the computation of the homogeneous solution of Nelson's method [36,37]. Consequently, design sensitivity analysis based on the combined normalization, will be also efficient and easy to be implemented in optimal design.

This section assumes that all eigenvalues and eigenvectors are distinct, that is, they are not repeated. A separate section will be devoted to repeated eigenvalues.

For the foregoing discussions, the derivatives of eigenvectors

                            cannot be found directly by utilizing Eq. (3). Therefore, an additional constraint should be imposed to uniquely determine the derivatives of eigenvectors. It is customary to obtain the constraint by differentiating normalization Eq. (2). Here, the constraint can be derived by differentiating normalization Eq.

                            will be not all of the same order of magnitude, which often causes a big condition number. Under the circumstances, there is small perturbation of the input which leads to a big change in the output (similar study can be seen in Li et al. [66]). To reduce the condition number, we keep the n

[64] for asymmetric systems with viscous damping. One of the remarkable characteristics of the proposed method is that its numerical stability is also proved, as demonstrated in Section 4.

                           The right-hand side of Eqs. (14) or (15) is a function of the ith eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector and their first-order sensitivity as well as the first and second sensitivities of system matrices.

Again, the constraint of the second-order derivatives of eigenvectors can be derived by differentiating normalization Eq. (8) twice

As can be seen, the second-order sensitivities of eigenvectors only require the calculation of vector

                            because the symmetric coefficient matrix

                            and its matrix decomposition (e.g. LDL
                              T
                            or LU decomposition) are available from the computation process of the first-order sensitivities of eigenvectors. For this reason, the computational cost of the second-order sensitivities of eigenvectors will be reduced remarkably once the first-order sensitivities are obtained (the first-order derivatives obtained by solving Eq. (10) need the number of operations O(N
                           3), however, only O(N
                           2) is required for finding the second-order derivatives). It is worth mentioning that b
                           
                              i
                            has been calculated in the computation process of the second-order sensitivities of eigenvalues. Therefore, the second sensitivities of eigenvectors are also compact, simple and easy to be implemented.

                           This expression gives the relation between the particular solution P and the eigenvalue sensitivity and can be considered as a constraint condition. An important property of Eq. (35) is that the relation does not depend on the undetermined matrix Q. One idea frequently come up is whether or not to have a method can deal with the derivatives of eigensolutions of damped systems in the form of the original space.

Let us consider the eigenproblem of the original space to find the eigenvector sensitivities

This section will show that the homogeneous solution can also be carried out in the form of the original space. Due to the fact that the particular solution has been found, it only remains to compute the coefficient matrix, c. Following the operations in these methods [58,63,64], differentiating Eq.

To determine the diagonal elements of matrix c, just like the case of distinct eigenvalues, an additional constraint should be imposed. Often the additional constraint can be derived by differentiating the normalization. In this study, a new normalization is proposed. For p=p
                           0, the adjacent eigenvectors satisfy the orthogonal normalization (23). Let

It is well known that in the context of viscously damped systems, their normalization is inconsistent with undamped or classically damped modal theories. For that reason, Eq. (41) cannot be degenerated to Eq. (58). Alternatively, one can choose the undamped eigenvectors normalized by 
                           2

                        , under such circumstances, it is easy to verify that Eq. (41) can be degenerated to Eq. (58) by following the same procedures. Here, the non-zero constant ξ can be determined by finding the largest element in absolute value of matrix

                         and dividing the largest element in absolute value of matrix MX.

The derivatives of repeated eigenvalues can be then obtained:

The objective in this section is to show that the two systems of algebraic equations expressed in Eqs. (10) and (40) are always solvable, i.e., how to prove that these coefficient matrices will not be singular or badly scaled.

This section will show that the coefficient matrix

The derivatives of eigensolutions are uniquely determined by the proposed method and shown in 
                        Table 1.

To illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method and show how to use the new combined normalization, the finite difference method is considered. The finite difference method is the easiest method to implement for calculating the eigensolution derivatives [3,32]. The eigensolution derivatives approximated by the first-order forward differences can be given as

As can be seen, for each design parameter p, the finite difference method must perform a complete reanalysis of eigensolutions. In addition, the finite difference method evaluates the true derivative with an error that is on the order of the step size Δp. Although the finite difference method is easy to program, it suffers from computational inefficiency and possible errors [32,65,66].


                        
                        Table 2 lists the approximated eigensolution derivatives computed by the finite difference method with respect to Δp=1N/m. It should be noted that normalization Eq. (7) is used to normalize the eigenvectors at design point p
                        0 and the normalization (8) is used to normalize the eigenvectors at p
                        0+Δp in the case of distinct eigenvalues, and similar procedures for eigenvectors associating to repeated eigenvalues.

As it can be seen from Tables 1 and 2, the eigensolution derivatives computed by the proposed method show a good agreement with the results approximated by the finite difference method.

To illustrate the robustness of the proposed method, a simple but representative three bar truss structure, shown in 
                        Fig. 2, is considered. The truss structure has Young's modulus E=2.1×1011
                        N/m2, material density ρ=7860kg/m3. The structure is modeled into three truss elements whose element stiffness and mass matrices are

As it can be noted, the condition number is remarkably reduced, hence the proposed method is numerically well-conditioned.

To illustrate the application and efficiency of the proposed method, a two-stage floating raft isolation system, shown in 
                        Fig. 3 is considered. It should be mentioned that an advanced isolation system used in engineering application is more complicated than the general two-stage isolation system and it can provide a much better vibration reduction than the latter.

As shown in Fig. 3, the machine vibration is attempted to be isolated by mounting two machines on a single intermediate raft structure. The two machines have the values: m
                           1=200kg, m
                           2=250kg. The length–width–thickness of raft plate and foundation plate are 1200–800–20mm and 2000–800–40mm, respectively. The four sides of raft plate are all free. The two short sides of foundation plate are clamped and two long sides of it are free. The raft and foundation plates have
                              
                                 Young's modulus: E=2.0×1011

Density: ρ=7800kg/m3
                                 

Poisson's ratio: μ=0.3.

Two springs and dashpots are used to mount two machines on a single intermediate raft structure, and eight springs and dashpots are fixed between raft plate and foundation plate. The spring stiffness coefficients and the damping coefficients have the following values:

As shown in 
                           Fig. 4, the finite element model, which is meshed using HyperMesh and modeled using the finite element software-NASTRAN [68], is discretized into 192 elements and has 1258 DOF. System matrices of the finite element model are assembled by NASTRAN and exported by means of DAMP language [69]. By using the system matrices, the proposed method is programmed by MATLAB. The distribution of the nonzero terms of system matrices is shown in 
                           Fig. 5 obtained by using the MATLAB function spy(·). This floating raft isolation system is a non-proportionally damped systems since it does not satisfy the mathematical condition presented by Caughey and O'Kelly [70] and Adhikari [71]. The lower 10 complex eigenvalues are listed in 
                           Table 3. It should be noted that the imaginary part of each complex eigenvalue is the natural frequency in rad/s. The real part of each complex eigenvalue is a measure of the decay rate of the raft system. The system is stable since all the real parts of eigenvalues or decay rate coefficients are negative.


                           
                              
                                 Case 1: Material density is considered as the design parameter

To illustrate the computation of the first- and second-order derivatives of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, the material density is chosen as the design parameter p. 
                                    Table 4 lists the first- and second-order derivatives of some eigenvalues with respect to material density at 7800kg/m3. It has been checked that the first- and second-order derivatives of eigenvalues calculated by the presented method have the same results with those calculated by Nelson's method [37]. As can be seen from Eq. (14), the second-order sensitivity of eigenvalue is a function of the first-order sensitivity of the corresponding eigenvector. It implies that the first-order sensitivities of eigenvectors obtained by using the proposed method can be also exactly obtained.

In general, the eigensolution sensitivity can be used to predict the changes of eigenvalues and eigenvectors with respect to the changes of design parameters, select a search direction and form an approximate model for optimization process, and assess the effects of uncertainties of structure or geometry property to system eigensolutions. In this example, the capacity of predicting the changes of eigensolutions with respect to the changes of design parameters is considered. As we know, to avoid performing a complete reanalysis of eigensolutions, Taylor expansion is usually used to approximate the change in eigensolution with respect to an arbitrary change in design parameters based on their first- and second-derivatives of eigensolutions. By using only the first term in Taylor expansion, the change in eigenvalue can be given by

                                     can be also approximated.

Next, the first- and second-order approximations are used to estimate the change in eigensolution from the change of material density. 
                                    
                                    Figs. 6 and 7 show the influence of changing the material density from 6500 to 9500kg/m3 on the imaginary and real parts of the third eigenvalue, respectively. The first- and second-order approximations of the third eigenvalue are compared with the exact eigenvalue. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the third natural frequency decrease to the variation of material density, the first-order approximation predicts the change in the frequency with good accuracy in the small perturbation region and the second-order approximation improves the approximate results and can predict the change in the frequency with excellent accuracy, even in the eigenvalues with a big change. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the third decay rate coefficient increase to the variation of material density. It is obvious that the first-order approximation predicts the change in the third decay rate coefficient with good accuracy in the small perturbation region and the second order approximation improves the approximate results. As a measure of the error of the first- and second-order approximations of eigenvectors, the relative error is defined as

                                    Fig. 8 shows the error of changing the material density on the third eigenvector. As can be observed, the first-order approximation predicts the change in the third eigenvectors with good accuracy and the second-order approximation makes the error reduce.

Case 2: Young's modulus is considered as the design parameter

In this case, the Young's modulus is chosen as the design parameter p. 
                                    Table 5 lists the first- and second-order derivatives of some eigenvalues with respect to Young's modulus at 2.0×1011
                                    N/m2. It is worth mentioning that the first- and second-order derivatives of eigenvalues calculated by the presented method are identical with those calculated by Nelson's method.

Next, the first- and second-order approximations are used to estimate the change in eigensolution from the change of Young's modulus. 
                                    
                                    Figs. 9 and 10 show the influence of changing the Young's modulus from 1.6×1011 to 2.4×1011
                                    N/m2 on the imaginary and real parts of the third eigenvalue, respectively. As can be seen from Figs. 9 and 10, the third natural frequency increase to the variation of Young's modulus, the third decay rate coefficient decrease to the variation of Young's modulus. In addition, the first-order approximation predicts the change in the frequency and decay rate coefficient with good accuracy in the small perturbation region and the second-order approximation can predict the change in the frequency with excellent accuracy, even in the eigenvalues with a big change. 
                                    Fig. 11 shows the error of changing the Young's modulus on the third eigenvector. As we can see, the first-order approximation predicts the change in the third eigenvectors with good accuracy and the second-order approximation makes the error reduce.

To illustrate the computational efficiency of the proposed method, the eigensolution sensitivities have been also computed by Nelson's method [37]. In this case, the Young's modulus is chosen as the design parameter p. The computational time of Nelson's method and the proposed method is considered with respect to the number of the computed eigensolution derivatives. The CPU time of the proposed method to obtain the first-order derivatives of the first 50 eigensolutions is 113.640s, which slightly reduced in comparison with those elapsed by Nelson's method (115.543s). The reason is that the first-order derivatives of eigenvectors need the matrix decomposition (e.g. LDL
                              T
                            or LU decomposition) of

                           3), however, only O(N
                           2) is required for finding the homogeneous solution of Nelson's method [37] that is not required for the proposed method (on the number of operations has been studied in Li et al. [66]).

                           2). In addition, the homogeneous solution of Nelson's method also requires O(N
                           2). For this reason, the computational cost of the second-order sensitivities of eigenvectors is reduced remarkably compared with Nelson's method.

Design sensitivity analysis of engineering structures deals with the computations of the rate of performance measure from changes in the design parameters describing the structure. The eigensolution sensitivity can be used to predict the changes of eigenvalues and eigenvectors with respect to the changes of design parameters, select a search direction and form an approximate model for optimization process, and assess the effects of uncertainties of structure or geometry property to system eigensolutions. This paper studied the eigensolution derivatives for symmetric viscously damped eigenproblems with distinct and repeated eigenvalues. To simplify the computation, a combined normalization, which combines two traditional normalizations, is presented. Based on the combined normalization, a method for sensitivity analysis of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is studied. In the case of distinct eigenvalues, the proposed method can determine the eigenvector derivatives directly and is robust since the components of coefficient matrices are all of the same order of magnitude. In the case of repeated eigenvalues, an algorithm is presented for computing the eigensolution sensitivities. The algorithm maintains N-space without using state-space equations such that the computational cost is reduced. The method is accurate, compact, numerically stable and easy to be implemented. In addition, the proposed method can be extended to compute the eigensolution derivatives of undamped systems with the similar produces. Finally, three numerical examples have demonstrated the validity of the proposed method. The capacity of predicting the changes of eigensolutions with respect to the changes of design parameters in terms of the first- and second-order eigensensitivities is studied with application to the analysis of a two-stage floating raft isolation system. The computational cost of the second-order sensitivities of eigenvectors can be reduced remarkably since the matrix decomposition of the coefficient matrix is available from the computation process of the first-order eigensensitivities and it has been verified by a two-stage floating raft isolation system with 1258 DOF.
