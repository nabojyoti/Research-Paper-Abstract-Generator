0,0,S0168874X14001516," Topology optimization problem requires repeated evaluations of the objective function and design sensitivity in the design domain with various density distributions. A repeated computations in the optimization process, requires a large amount of computing time and resources. These issues have inspired the development of optimization techniques combined with a system reduction. In order to reduce the system, this study employs a system dynamic condensation method based on selected primary degrees of freedom. Based on a system reduction, this study performs a topology optimization to maximize the eigenvalue and linear summation of each eigenvalue. In the optimization procedure, mode tracking method, called MAC, is used to pursue target modes, and the design sensitivity is calculated by a method of the rigid body mode separation assuring the reliability of sensitivity regardless of the design variable perturbation size. Each result of the numerical examples based on the reduction system is compared to that of the full system. Through a few numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide efficient and reliable results in topology optimization. ","Traditionally, the size and shape optimization has been the main stream in the structural optimization field. Shape optimization, which deals with the modification of external shape, has a disadvantage in that the distorted mesh should be regenerated when elements are distorted during the optimization process. developed topology optimization to minimize compliance in static problems [13]. One is the higher order eigen-pair perturbation algorithm and the other is the cross-orthogonality check method. In particular, the analysis of a large scale structure takes enormous computing time. There are two kinds of methods based on the primary degrees of freedom (PDOFs) and the mode-based structural reduced order model (ROM) in the reduction system. This study proposes an efficient topology optimization based on the system reduction. Section 3 presents the general topology optimization including the mode tracking method. Section 4 evaluates the formulation of the sensitivity in topology optimization. Section 5 presents the maximization of the eigen-frequencies of a beam and plate by the proposed optimization method. The accuracy and efficiency of the reduced system approach for each example is compared to that of full system. In the first step, the scheme selects the candidate area by Rayleigh energy ratio. This method, which is based on the Improved Reduced System (IRS, [13]) was proposed for an efficient reduction system by Kim and Cho [9]. In the first step, in which the candidate regions for PDOFs are selected, the modified Rayleigh quotient considering the density of elements is evaluated to consider the void element in topology optimization. The first Ritz vector {z                            1} is obtained by the mass-normalization procedure of this static vector as shown in Eq. ( The transformation relation between PDOFs and SDOFs is given in Eq. ( In the second step, the SEM is applied to the reduced candidate region of the system that was constructed from the first step. Even if the homogenization design method has an advantage, which is relaxation of the concept and domain in the continuum field, it is hard to implement the computational program. On the other hand, because SIMP has the same essence as the homogenization design method: It is easy to implement the computational program. Because of this advantage of SIMP, many researchers have employed the SIMP method for topology optimization. The range of the design variable is defined between 0 (a void element) and 1 (a solid element) to express the exact density of each element. 10), differentiation of the objective function with respect to the design variable                                                e                       yields Eq. ( Moreover, it would be highly efficient to employ the reduced system approach in a large-scaled eigenvalue problem [9]. In the present study, we employ the four nodes hybrid stress shell element with drilling degree of freedom [17]. 5 shows the candidate area and PDOFs every-5-iteration until the 20th iteration process. The second eigenvalue is maximized to 266 as shown in                             Fig. 10 and the final configuration is optimized showing the identical result between the full system and the reduction system as shown in                             Fig. The example of this section maximizes the linear summation of the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue of a beam. Thus, the weighting factors are defined as w                            1=1.0, w                            2=0.4. 13, it is assured that the topology optimization based on the reduction system can be performed with reliability. The next example is the application for a plate with a concentrated mass. Every 15-iteration, the candidate area and PDOFs are shown in                             Fig. The candidate areas and PDOFs every 20-iteration is given in                             Fig. After the 10th iteration, the jumping scheme is applied and the information on the PDOFs is updated using the TLCS every 5-iteration. As a result, the proposed method provides a reliable result of topology optimization compared to that of a full system and saves the computing time due to the efficiency of the reduced system.",0.7422072451558551,0.2069046500704556,0.3236005985955525,0.0761904761904762,0.2484472049689441,0.11661807220949617,0.17073170731707318,0.47115384615384615,0.250639382284522
1,1,S0168874X14001528," Accuracy and efficiency are significant factors in wave propagation and load identification of mechanical structure. By introducing modified Hermitian cubic spline wavelets on interval (HCSWI), a multi-scale wavelet-based numerical method is proposed. The present method can avoid the boundary problem of the original Hermitian interpolation wavelet. A modified Hermitian interpolation wavelet base can get transformation matrix, so the modified Hermitian wavelet finite element is proposed in this paper. Positive question-wave propagation and inverse question-load identification is verified by this means. The modified Hermitian wavelet finite element involves wave propagation and load identification in rod and Timoshenko beam which are obtained and then compared with results calculated by traditional finite element method (TFEM) and B-spline wavelet on interval (BSWI) finite element. The results indicate that the present method for wave propagation and load identification has higher precision and costs less time on mechanical structure. ","Wave propagation and load identification are the key subjects of intensive investigations in mechanical engineering over the years [1,2]. Thus, accuracy and efficiency are importantly and greatly required for finite element techniques when they are used in high frequency wave propagation simulation [9]. Finite element method (FEM) has been playing an important role in many engineering fields. Since B-spline wavelets have explicit expressions, high degree of accuracy and high efficiency, numerous researchers focus on the B-spline wavelet on interval (BSWI) finite element method [23,24]. For the orthogonal characteristic of the wavelet bases with respect to the given inner product, the corresponding multi-scale solution equation will be decoupled across levels totally or partially and it suits for the nesting approximation. constructed biorthogonal multi-wavelets on the basis of the Hermite cubic splines                       1 and                       2                       [31]. The shifts of                       1 and                       2 generate the wavelet space W.                       Fig. 2 shows the graphic of                       1 and                       2. These features make HCSWI as a finite element interpolation function better than that of BSWI. 8 shows the lifting scheme for the wavelet based numerical method. Therefore, the unknown function could be entirely expanded in terms of the wavelets. 31), only the sub-matrices C                                               x,y                      , (x=                      1                      ,,                                               j1; y=                                               l                      )will be calculated when the scale l is lifted to l+1 and other sub-matrices will be preserved. The excitation signal used in this section is the product of a sinusoidal signal with frequency 100kHz modulated and amplitude 2 by Hanning window in the left side of rod or beam (in                          Fig. In all examples, a computer with an Intel CPU 3.1GHz and memory 4G bytes is used, and we select Matlab and 64bit Windows 7 operating system. 11(a) shows the middle side wave propagation of rod with different scales of HCSWI. The results of scale at j=3 of HCSWI elements are close to that of 600 TFEM. 11(b) shows the middle side wave propagation of rod with different method. 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 have higher precision than BSWI elements in 4 order 3 scale of rod. The process is consistent with the actual process of wave propagation [5]. The second wave is propagated over the respond by the excitation signal at the middle side. The first wave propagation spread continuously from left to right, when it reaches the rod fixed end reversely. Table 2 shows the left side and the middle side wave propagation with time consumption of Timoshenko beam with different methods. As the scale ascension of HCSWI, the precision of load identification is higher than that of low scale of HCSWI. The accuracy of scale j=3 of HCSWI elements is close to that of the exact solution. 19(b) displays the middle side load identification of rod with 30 HCSWI elements, 30 BSWI elements and 600 TFEM. Compared with the 600 TFEM, the accuracy of 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 is close to that of 600 TFEM, but time consumption is less than that of TFEM. 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 have higher precision and less time consumption than BSWI elements in 4 order 3 scale of rod. The result of 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 is close to that of the exact solution. 21(a) shows the left side load identification of beam with different scales of HCSWI. 21(b) shows the left side load identification of rod with 30 HCSWI elements, 30 BSWI elements and 600 TFEM. The precision of load identification is higher than that of low scale of HCSWI, as the scale ascension of HCSWI. HCSWI has the good performance of the lifting scheme observed when the wavelets are added step by step to realize multi-scale approximation of the rod and beam, but the ascending scale way of BSWI is more complex. By using modified HCSWI, a multi-scale wavelet-based numerical method is proposed. In practical engineering applications the modified finite element model can be used to simulate wave propagation and load identification.

2,2,S0168874X14001413," The topic of the paper is related to the macroscopic modelling of riveted assemblies for full-scale aircraft structures subjected to crash/impact loadings. Super-elements have been developed to model the rivet and its rupture. However, stress concentrations in riveted assemblies can also initiate cracks from hole boundaries that propagate to the next ones and can lead to the catastrophic loss of the airplane by dismantlement of structural parts. An hybrid-Trefftz perforated super-element has been previously developed by the authors. However, the hole boundary of this super-element is a traction-free analytical boundary, preventing any connection with rivet elements. As a necessary first step to make the connection with the rivet possible, it is proposed to formulate additional nodes on the hole boundary of the perforated super-element. However, increasing the number of nodes implies increasing the super-element interpolation functions series order. Their ability to accurately describe the strain and stress fields is evaluated. It is found that when the series order is increased, the mechanical fields are still well described, but are a little less accurate than lower order interpolation functions. This evolution is discussed and seems to be linked to the ill-conditioning of the system. The accuracy is however still sufficient for the formulation of a 16-node super-element featuring eight nodes on the hole boundary. ","Finite element analysis (FEA) of airframe under high velocity impacts hardly succeeds in representing the failure of the structure when it occurs in riveted joint areas. Piltner [7] formulated a super-element featuring an elliptical hole. Most of the above-mentioned elements featuring geometrical discontinuities are hybrid-Trefftz displacement finite elements because, with this approach, complex mechanical fields near the defect can be represented without the need to mesh finely the area. Consequently, loadings cannot be exchanged between the rivet macro-model and the perforated plane element. The increase in the number of nodes of the perforated super-element implies an increase in the number of series terms of the interpolation functions (i.e., an increase in the order of the Laurent series). The boundaries S                                                     u                          and S                                                     t                          represent the prescribed displacement boundary and the prescribed traction boundary, respectively. This minimum number does not always guarantee a stiffness matrix with full rank. However, too many parameters would make the element become too stiff [26,28,31]. Note that these rules do not vary wherever the dofs are placed (in particular along the internal or external boundaries). 1(b)), it is proposed to study the interpolation functions associated with this super-element. 2                         ) has no influence on the KM solution [8]. The truncation order of the series in the KM solution (2)(6): N and M, with N=M.  The number of data points (where displacements are collected on the reference solution). The equivalent von Mises stress field obtained for this test-case is presented in Fig. This configuration is the less accurate among all those studied. 3); the maximal percent error being to the worst for the component                                                      xy                          and is about                                                                                              10                                                                                                                                  4                                                                                       %                         . The analytical expression of x-displacement, for example, for the three above-mentioned load cases is thus given by Eqs. ( 2 and the two orders 4 and 8, is undertaken for these new test-cases. The conclusions are similar compared to the previous uniaxial tensile test-case: whatever the test-case considered, the maximal percent error increases when the order is equal to 8 and particularly when data points are located on the hole boundary. This problem has been encountered in the literature by Rezaiee et al. [ The two proposed solutions have been evaluated and compared at one or two positions near the hole for the calculation of hoop stress. The study presented in the present paper endeavours to analyse each obtained solution in the whole domain                                                                                     [                                                              1                               ,                               1                               ]                                                                                       2                                                                           , and not only at few points. It should be noted that close to the hole, all configurations give good results too and in particular for the value of the hoop stress (the maximal percent error in Tables 1 and 2 are never observed at the hole boundary). The value of the condition number of the matrix                                                                                     A                                                                                       ls                                                                            is given in Table 3                       according to each configuration. Nevertheless, even if the solution computed from KM functions remains still very close to the reference solution for all considered load cases, the paper highlights the fact that the obtained results are counter-intuitive. Indeed, the accuracy of the computed solution decreases when increasing the series order, due to the increased sensitivity. The ill-conditioning of the system is suggested as being the origin of the sensitivity of these interpolation functions. Finally, these inaccuracies at order 8 are not significant, and they are not a priori an obstacle for the forthcoming developments. Therefore, the theoretical formulation of a 16-node perforated super-element featuring eight nodes on its perforation (i.e., the variational principle and the stiffness matrix) will be presented in a future paper.

3,3,S0168874X14001437," Automotive door sealing system isolates passenger compartment from water, dust and wind noise. It has the most direct influences on door-closing performance, which is determined by cross-section design in terms of its appropriate Compression Load Deflection (CLD) property. Traditional sealing structure has uniform geometrical cross-section. It has the shortcomings of bad fitting in corner parts with large curvatures, causing inaccurate door-closing effort design. Regarding the door panels complex 3D profile, numerical analysis and optimal design for new sealing with variable cross-section are developed in this paper. Firstly, the whole sealing is partitioned into several parts. For four nearly straight segments, conventional 2D numerical analysis can still be used to obtain desired geometrical configuration. For other four curved corner parts with large curvatures, 3D numerical analysis of door closing is applied. Secondly, 2D geometrical cross-section optimization is proposed. Instead of three variables in previous research, five variables are selected for featuring cross-section geometry and used for next CAD reconstruction with more precision. After comparison between Back Propagation (BP) neural network and the Kriging surrogate model, BP neural network which performs better and efficient in this automotive design optimization field is applied for extracting nonlinear mapping between five cross-section parameters and compression load, which were parallely optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and its efficiency and accuracy are compared with another evolutionary algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thirdly, 3D numerical modeling of four curved corner parts closing process is realized, of which twisting and bending effects during seal assembly are taken into account, thus minimizing theoretical error and producing more realistic solution. Consequently, the desired geometrical configurations for both straight parts and corner parts satisfying designated CLD property can be obtained and the whole sealing can be achieved with variable cross-section, resulting in an ideal door closing effort. Finally, a Matlab-based platform has been developed to assist the design and optimization process. Experiment and case study indicates that it provides an effective method for new door sealing design with variable cross-section. ","Automotive door seals are installed in narrow gaps between door and body frame along the perimeters of the opening panels, as shown in                       Fig. It was revealed that door sealing consumes 3550% energy during the door closing process [2], thus making it become the dominant role for door closing effort design [35]. A good door sealing design needs to satisfy both the sealing quality and the door-closing performance. Nowadays, computational efforts have been implemented for door seal design. Although numerical analysis makes great contributions to the door seal design, there still exists some problems for this high non-linear behavior. Very few parameters of height and wall thickness are selected for geometrical description. It is simple for design, but would cause inaccurate reconstruction of geometrical configuration. A typical door sealing is geometrically divided into eight segments, considering the curvature change of true profile. Based on Genetic Algorithm, cross-section parameters are parallely optimized. By using 2D cross-section optimization for nearly straight segments of door seal and 3D numerical analysis for the rest of the corner parts, the whole sealing can be designed with variable cross section. Traditional sealing structure has uniform geometrical cross-section. Door seals use Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) sponge rubber. Test process is performed based on the standard GB/T 528-2009. The dimensions of test specimen are shown in                          Fig. In order to predict sealing performance and door-closing force, the chemical, mechanical properties and the constitutive model of rubber material must be considered; moreover, the different orders of the same material constitutive model also influence the reliability of the simulation results. 1] to select suitable material model for the experimental results. Then, genetic algorithm is applied to parallely search cross section parameters. In fact, rib segment is very sensitive to compression load according to study in this paper, and a penalty function technique is used to handle the contact constraints in the finite element contact simulation. 9 shows the poor sealing performance caused by rib and the comparison of compression response with and without rib structure. To evaluate the performance of a seal product under actual conditions, the seal deformation is checked in three critical configurations depending on the relative position of the door and frames, denoted by D2, D, D+2 in Fig. D represents the complete closing condition, while D2 and D+2 are slightly less and more deformed conditions, respectively. BP neural network can realize complicated implicit mapping as long as it has enough hidden layers and points. It was adopted in this paper for extracting mapping between five variables of cross-section and the desired CLD response with the closest approximation algorithm. Table 9 shows the five variables of the original section and the comparison of BP neural network results and Kriging ones is shown in                             Table 6. After many trials, its best operating parameters can be obtained and are listed in                             Table 8. When corner parts were compressed during door closing, the compression load would be generated from both the normal force as well as the tangent force and twisting force, causing inaccurate calculation of compression force if only using the CLD property obtained from 2D cross-section analysis. The door sheet metal and body frame metal are defined as rigid body and the seal is regarded as the deformable body characterized by the constitutive model of Foam after verification of sealing rubber material as mentioned. 23 and 24 show its application for an engineering case study. Door panels large curvature causes sealing, bending and twisting effect on door closing effort. 3D numerical analysis of door corner part assembly and closing process must be modeled so that corners compression load is calculated directly instead of using CLD from 2D analysis. 51275359), Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacture for Thin-walled Structures project (No. Director Dr. DAI Yuankan and Research Manager XIA Guoyong of HUAYU-COOPER Standard Sealing System CO.,",0.5874155405405406,0.3245450303313112,0.4180953334750503,0.08680555555555555,0.16611295681063123,0.11402508101044186,0.24355300859598855,0.4358974358974359,0.31249999540069484
4,4,S0168874X14001425," Multi-scale finite element (FE) modeling and analysis of engineering structures have become very necessary in order to provide both global and local structural information for a comprehensive assessment of structural safety. The multi-scale FE modeling needs FE coupling methods to combine mixed-dimensional finite elements, such as beam-to-shell and plate-to-solid, in a single structural model. This paper presents a new mixed-dimensional FE coupling method that can achieve both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium at the interface between the different element types. The principle of virtual work is first used to derive both linear force and displacement constraint equations for the interface. A numerical method compatible with commercial FE codes is developed to figure out the linear constraint equations which satisfy both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium conditions at the interface. The proposed coupling method is then extended to nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling problems. Finally, the proposed coupling method is applied to a number of test cases including linear beam-to-plate, beam-to-shell and beam-to-solid interface problems, a linear frame structure, and a beam-to-shell buckling problem. The obtained results are also compared with those from the existing methods. It reveals that the proposed coupling method can handle both linear and nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling problems more accurately than the existing methods and that it can be applied to a structure satisfactorily for multi-scale simulation. ","Finite element (FE) modeling and analysis of an engineering structure nowadays are a common practice to understand structural behavior and assess structural safety. Broadly speaking, there are two major coupling methods currently available: volume coupling and surface coupling [5]. The MPC method can be used for static and dynamic analysis of linear or nonlinear structures [1722]. There are mainly two types of the MPC method: the rigid interface method and the deformable interface method. The elimination scheme enforces the MPC method by eliminating dependent DOFs. The principle of virtual work is first used to derive both linear force and displacement constraint equations for the interface. The proposed coupling method is then extended to nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling problems. To validate the proposed coupling method, a number of finite element test cases are finally examined. These cases include linear beam-to-plate, beam-to-shell and beam-to-solid connections for linear mixed-dimensional FE coupling, a linear frame structure for structural multi-scale simulation, and a beam-to-shell buckling problem for nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling. The mixed-dimensional FE model of the beam and plate connection is shown in                       Fig. 2), we have                                                                                                              u                                                                                       B                                                                              =                         C                                                                                                             u                                                                                       P                                                                           . The coefficient matrix                                                                                     C                                                        T                                                of the force constraint equation can be regarded as a distribution matrix to distribute the forces or moment at the node of the beam to the nodes of the plate at the interface. 1) and (7) can achieve both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium at the interface between the different element types. 4, so that the substructure has the same mesh and element type with the plate at the interface. The nodal force model is formed by repeating the substructure with the same mesh and element type, as shown in                          Fig. Then, the iteration process will guarantee the accuracy of the coefficient matrix of the constraint equation without end effects. Initially, the rigid connections are used to connect the loading node and all the nodes at the corresponding end section. The new nodal force vector and then the new coefficient matrix are calculated. Moreover, it is also convenient to be applied to more than two members of arbitrary cross section at a structural joint using more than two interfaces. 7, is used to illustrate how to construct nonlinear constraint equations for nonlinear interface coupling. In consideration that the interface moves during the nonlinear solution process, the nonlinear displacement and force constraint equations are first developed in a local interface coordinate system (CS) at the interface. The constraint equations are then transformed to a global CS for solution. The relationship between the coefficient matrices of the nonlinear force and displacement constraint equations for the interface is derived in this section. The nonlinearity of the coefficient matrix of the constraint equation is due to the change of stiffness at the interface caused by materials and geometrical nonlinearity. The force distribution matrix in the local coordinate system is calculated using the method proposed in Section 3 in which the stiffness matrix at the interface of shell is extracted during the nonlinear iteration process. The force distribution matrix in the global coordinate system can be determined through coordinate transformation. Use the constraint equation in the initial configuration to calculate the response of the system. The computation of the coefficient matrix                                                                                              C                                                                                                t                                                                                     in the local coordinate system may need huge computation time. 18) is only suitable for the interface without material nonlinearity. By combining the nonlinear constraint equations with the nonlinear FE model of the structure, one can use the Newton iteration process to find the solution of the structure with nonlinear constraint equations. This section will examine a number of finite element cases using the proposed coupling method, and the results will be compared with those obtained from the existing methods to validate the proposed coupling method. A cantilever of a solid rectangular cross-section, as shown in                          Fig. It is clamped on the left end and subjected to a concentrated force on the right. The proposed method can thus give more accurate results in shear stress distribution in the plate at the interface than the McCune method. Furthermore, the McCune method and the RBE3 method in ANSYS are also considered for comparison. The McCune method needs to assume stress distribution over the box cross-section. Table 3 lists the maximum Von Mises stress and the maximum shear stress obtained from the four methods as well as the relative error by taking the exact solution as a reference. The results from the proposed method are almost the same as the results from the pure shell model. The stresses of the cantilever with the same multi-scale model as discussed above are also calculated for the cantilever under the action of a torsion of 10kNcm at the left end using the four different methods. The torsion-induced Von Mises stress contours are calculated and plotted in                                                                                                     Figs. A concentrated force is applied in the y-direction on the left end of the cantilever. The comparisons are also made for the deflection at the left end of the cantilever and the maximum Von Mises stress among different methods/models. 30 shows a frame structure constructed by one beam and two columns of I cross-section. The mid-span deflection of the beam is calculated using different methods and listed in                          Table 5. The relative errors of the deflection at the mid span of the beam calculated by the proposed method, the McCune method and the RBE3 method are 0.81%, 0.81% and 4.19%, respectively, which indicates that the proposed method has a good accuracy for deflection results. The stress results from the RBE3 method, however, show serious stress disturbance at the interface between the beam and column. The maximum Von Mises stresses are 170.2, 182.8 and 170.2MPa from the proposed method, the distributing coupling method and the pure shell model respectively. A numerical method compatible with commercial FE codes has been developed to figure out the linear and nonlinear constraint equations which satisfy both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium conditions at the interface. In particular, the proposed methods always yield more accurate stress results and stress distribution at the interface.",0.8266666666666667,0.1698851774530271,0.2818496566402229,0.13811420982735723,0.5445026178010471,0.22033897982299,0.27873563218390807,0.7950819672131147,0.41276595360289736
5,5,S0168874X14001541," Bridging domain method (BDM) is a multiscale method which couples molecular dynamics (MD) with finite element simulations. In this paper, using numerical study we show that time integration step size and the discretization of Lagrange multipliers can highly impact the capability of BDM in removing spurious reflections. We present a technique to enhance the performance of bridging domain method and to alleviate the effects of the two aforementioned factors on the BDM. In our technique, the total displacement field of the atoms located in the overlapping zone is decomposed into a coarse and a fine field. The equations of motion of fine scale oscillations are first obtained and then modified to include a damping term. The damping condition effectively filters out and removes the fine scale oscillations that cannot pass into the continuum domain; hence eliminates the spurious wave reflections. Using numerical examples, we show that the proposed enhancement significantly improves the performance of bridging domain method. This is specially significant when discontinuities such as cracks are present in the domain or when the integration time step is small. ","Molecular dynamics simulations provide vast amount of information about material behavior at nanoscale. To avoid the spurious wave reflections, the interface between the atomistic and continuum should be such that coarse scale information (low frequency waves) can be accurately transmitted in both directions, whereas the fine scale oscillations which cannot be transmitted into the continuum zone should be eliminated at the interface. In Section 3, we numerically study the performance of the BDM method and will provide the motivation of the proposed enhancement. The compatibility of deformation between atomistic and continuum domain in the overlapping zone can be imposed in different ways [9,10,36,37]. Therefore, we employ a predictor-corrector velocity Verlet algorithm to update the atomistic and continuum displacement and velocity fields. The displacement field obtained at this stage is called predicted displacement field. ( These steps can be repeated until the displacement fields and Lagrange multipliers (                            d                            ,                            u                          and                                                      ) converge. The snapshots of the simulation results at t=2ps are depicted in Fig. 3a and b show that consistent constraint matrix is not very successful in eliminating spurious reflections of high frequency waves into the MD domain using either large or small integration time steps. The Hamiltonian of the entire domain along with the Hamiltonian of the atomistic and continuum subdomains are shown in Fig. 4a and b show that when consistent constraint matrix is employed, the Hamiltonian of the entire system remains constant and the Hamiltonian of atomistic zone does not go to zero. Therefore, no wave component is trapped in the atomistic zone. For this purpose, we obtain the equations of motion of fine scale oscillations and modify it to include a damping term. This idea was later used to develop other multiscale methods such as perfectly matched multiscale method [40]. The fine scale displacements cannot be resolved by the continuum mesh and should be eliminated. Using viscous damping, a damping force proportional to fine velocity of the atom is applied to the fine motion of each atom. The selection of an appropriate damping coefficient is described in Section 4.3. This gives the total atomic displacement after the elimination of fine scale oscillations. This necessitates some considerations to be taken into account when the damping coefficient is chosen. 2), and                                                                                              C                                                                                                                                                                                     is a user-defined parameter. Using this approximation, very little spurious reflections are developed near                                                                                                                                                                                              C                                                                                    , and the fine scale displacements are effectively eliminated. We solve one- and two-dimensional examples to investigate the performance of the proposed enhancements. All the numerical simulations are conducted at an absolute zero temperature and the reference solution of all the problems are obtained by using a fully atomistic description of the entire domain. The total Hamiltonian of the atomistic zone versus time obtained using displacement and velocity constraints are shown in Figs. 6 and 7                                                  , respectively. These plots also confirm that regardless of the size of the overlapping domain, standard BDM methods are more successful in removing spurious reflections when the integration time step is large. For this problem, we use =0.467eV and =0.2296nm which leads to an equilibrium bond length of r                         0=0.2577nm of the triangular lattice. The entire domain dimensions are 63.02nm60.49nm and the initial crack length is 10nm. 8                         ) is applied to the upper and lower edges of the continuum domain. The new cracks then grow along                                                                                                                                                                                              A                                                                                     to the side edges of the domain. By increasing the size of overlapping zone, the crack growth path obtained from standard BDM approaches that of pure MD, however this example clearly shows that EBDM is more efficient in modeling problems involving discontinuities. 8 is used to prescribe both tensile and shear components of the external loading. Therefore, standard BDM methods are capable of predicting the correct crack path only when the overlapping length is large. CONCLUSIONS   In this paper, we investigated the performance of standard bridging domain method as a function of overlapping length size, the form of Lagrange multipliers discretization (strict versus weak compatibility), the type of constraint matrix (consistent versus diagonalized), the integration time step size, and the type of constraint between atomistic and continuum domain in the overlapping zone (displacement versus velocity constraint). In contrast to the standard bridging domain methods, by reducing the time step size, the performance of enhanced bridging domain method improves.

6,6,S0168874X14001619," Laser-assisted machining combines several experimental parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, laser power and distance between tool rake face and the laser beam axis. The optimization of these parameters is necessary to ensure the efficiency of assistance and to increase productivity. This paper focuses on the understanding of the physical phenomena during laser-assisted machining, and on optimising this process. This contribution is based on an experimental and a numerical study. The experimentalpart highlights the effects of the laser power as well as the distance between the tool rake face and the axis of the laser beam. As for the numerical part, it was performed on the ABAQUS/Explicit software. The proposed model improves the understanding of the physical phenomena of chip formation and the cutting force reduction when machining with laser assistance. In addition, this model allows a better optimization of laser and cutting parameters.Numerical findings generally corroborate experimental results and can lead to some other information difficult to catch experimentally. The main contention in the paper is that the distance between the axis of the laser beam and the tool rake face is the most important parameter that controls the reduction of the cutting force. This cutting force reduction can exceed 50%. ","Titanium alloys are known for their high mechanical characteristics even at high temperatures and for their corrosion resistance. The combination of high mechanical properties, low density and corrosion resistance presents interesting advantages for titanium alloys. The study done by Ding and Shin [3] proves that there is an improvement in surface roughness and that there is no microstructural change. Lesourd [5] was among the first to develop a finite element model for laser-assisted machining (LAM). Thus, the understanding of laser heating on the chip formation becomes more relevant. The tungsten carbide tool is considered deformable, flank angle =7, rake angle =7 and nose radius                                                                                              r                                                                                                                                                                                       =                            30                                                                                    m                         . One of the most widely used behavior laws is the JohnsonCook constitutive equation (1)                          [10]. Johnson and Cook [11] have developed in the mid 1980s a damage model which takes into account the sensitivity to strain rate, temperature and hydrostatic pressure . Table 2                          illustrates the parameters of the behavior and the damage law used. The model allows, among others, to simulate the formation of shear bands during chip genesis. For the ASB that is formed, the temperature reaches its maximum and the stress reaches its minimum. Physically, laser heating is carried out by the absorption of the laser beam on only few nanometers. In fact, the purely thermal simulation described previously, allows us to know the optimal distance between the tool and the laser beam. The depth affected by the heating depends mainly on the speed of the laser beam, its power and the distance a between the cutting face of the tool and the beam axis. The contact between the tool and the workpiece is handled by a masterslave algorithm. 7                          shows the temperature fields in different conditions at a point of the tool rake face. In LAM, for a cutting speed of about 80m/min the average temperature of the material that will be machined, just before the primary zone, is approximately 350C at 500W and 600C at 1000W. In these conditions, temperature of the tool is not strongly influenced by the laser power (Fig. This reduction is due to the decrease of the flow stress caused by laser heating. The machine used is a dedicated hard turning REALMECA RT-5, modified to receive the focusing laser head on a specific gantry (5 axes). Tests were conducted on the basis of an experimental design plan that covers a wide range of cutting conditions and parameters of the laser source. However, an increase in the cutting speed or in the feed rate leads to a decrease in the rate of reduction in the cutting forces. However, this could cause the melting and the bonding of the chip on the rake face of the tool. This shows remarkable differences between the chips obtained by conventional machining tests and those obtained by laser-assisted machining tests. These changes in the shear angle  and the distance Dc generate an increased frequency of segmentation of the chip. CONCLUSION   A new cutting model was developed to understand the mechanics of chip formation in the case of laser-assisted machining. On the basis of a heating model, it was possible to optimize the laser parameters, in particular, the laser power and the distance between the laser beam axis and the tool rake face.",0.6555555555555556,0.2362520021356113,0.347332201241505,0.05739514348785872,0.15204678362573099,0.08333332935450587,0.15671641791044777,0.4,0.22520106834089235
7,7,S0168874X14001620," Although optimization methods are useful in the preliminary design of cable-stayed bridges for sizing of components and getting optimal bridge configurations, further fine-tuning is invariably conducted in the detailed design thus affecting various sensitive properties such as the deck profile and cable forces. The zero-displacement method that adjusts the initial cable lengths repeatedly to achieve the design deck profile is both computationally intensive and prone to convergence difficulty. Therefore a calibration method is proposed based on a Kriging surrogate model built using the uniform design approach. Apart from establishing the relationship between the bridge deck geometry and the initial cable forces by statistical method, the Kriging model also obviates the need for a large number of repeated finite element analyses. A simple cable-stayed bridge is used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In real-life cable-stayed bridges with many cables, a staged calibration is implemented so that the Kriging model is used to identify reasonable initial forces in the critical stay cables so that the zero-displacement method or similar can be used for further adjustments. Verification shows that this staged calibration can address not only the deck level tolerance but also the control of cable forces. ","Cable-stayed bridges have become more and more popular over the past 50 years because of their desirable structural and aesthetic characteristics. In the determination of the dynamic and static responses, it is inevitable to have discrepancies between the predictions by the structural model and their corresponding measured values. The force equilibrium method [9] can easily account for the effect of prestressing and the additional bending moments due to the vertical profile of bridge deck, and therefore it can also address concerns of the long-term time-dependent behaviour. In view of the complexity of real-life cable-stayed bridges, cable force calibration is often achieved by iteration using various commercial finite element packages with programming facilities [11] that allow optimization to be carried out under various constraints considered appropriate. After specifying a set of initial cable forces by approximate equilibrium conditions or certain assumed initial cable strains or stresses, structural analysis is conducted. The redistributed cable forces under permanent loading are extracted and the criteria for iteration are checked. If the deviations are considered unacceptable, the cable strains are modified, and then the optimization process is repeated until the specified tolerance is satisfied. The surrogate model, which can be constructed after determining the relationship between the variables and the responses using design points [13], has the advantages of high efficiency, easy implementation and adequate accuracy. Compared with the conventional response surface method that requires an understanding of the qualitative tendency of the entire design space, the Kriging model [18] provides better flexibility of modelling response data with multiple local extreme values. For those bridges with a large number of cables, the surrogate model can be used efficiently together with the traditional method. The uncertainties of the identified initial cable forces due to modelling errors and measurement noise can be quantified separately by the analysis of variance [27,28] so that a full factorial design of experiments can be applied to the corresponding factors. The essence of Kriging model applied is briefly described here. In a problem with s design sites, each design site is defined by n coordinate components while each response has m components. The procedures of calibration of initial cable forces by the Kriging model are explained below and also compared with the traditional method in the form of flowcharts in                          Fig. (a)                               The sampling points of the initial cable forces are generated using the techniques of experiment design. Updating procedure is processed in the established Kriging model. The initial cable forces of the simple cable-stayed bridge [32,33] shown in                       Fig. The finite element model of the bridge is constructed using the commercial package ANSYS Multiphysics 12.0 [34]. For simplicity in monitoring the subsequent results, the correct forces of Cables 16 are assumed to be [11 11 10 10 9 9] 103                      kN respectively. The deck is modelled by 84 beam elements while the towers are modelled by 8 beam elements. As long as the estimated initial cable forces are reasonable, the sensitivity results are not affected much. Each group of cable force is varied while keeping all others unchanged for the evaluation of the associated changes in displacement at the control points. To start with, the finite element model is built up with the initial cable lengths as calculated geometrically from the drawings and the permanent loading is then applied. However, if the tolerance for iterations is set too strict, the cable forces in many cases may stop at the limits of the allowable range and fail to converge. These random errors are assumed to be normally distributed and independent of one another. Only 7 key structural parameters have been chosen for demonstration as shown in                          Table 11 because they govern the amount of subsequent computations. However it is observed that interaction between cable forces and deck levels is stronger within either the left or right half, but interaction between the two halves is less strong. The statistics of the identified cable forces due to uncertainties of deck level measurements are given in                          Table 13. 6 shows that the uncertainty of dead load of girder is the most significant among structural parameters, which is reasonable as the cables are direct load-carrying components. will significantly affect the identification of cable forces. Ting Kau Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge in Hong Kong with a total length of 1177m completed in 1998. 9 from A to D and E to I for those at the Ting Kau End and Tsing Yi End respectively. In addition, the common expediency of modelling a group of closely spaced cables as an equivalent cable also requires further calibration. 11(a) shows that the displacement of the 1st girder under permanent load has a maximum of around 8mm, where the nodes are numbered sequentially from the Ting Kau End. 9 are set at 20mm, and the initial tolerances at points F and I are set at 10mm; elsewhere the tolerance is taken as 5mm. A calibration method based on a Kriging surrogate model is therefore proposed. With the set of reasonable initial cable forces, further calibration can be carried out by iteration to satisfy not only the deck level tolerance but also the allowable cable stresses.",0.7890044576523031,0.1907327586206896,0.3072037456186283,0.07142857142857142,0.29120879120879123,0.1147186115551621,0.15555555555555556,0.5294117647058824,0.24045801175667214
8,8,S0168874X14001577," In this paper, the concept of configurational forces is introduced in the context of finite element mesh refinement for elasticideally plastic problems. This paper also includes the numerical computation of configurational forces in the elastic and plastic domains. Methods are demonstrated on three plane problems where the analytical solution is available. The first example is a thick-walled tube loaded by internal pressure. This simple, one dimensional problem allows computation of configurational volume forces analytically to validate the finite element (FE) results. The second example is Galins problem that involves an infinite plate with a circular hole loaded by biaxial tension at the infinity. This is a two dimensional problem for which the analytical solution is known with some restrictions for elasticideally plastic case when Tresca yield criterion is considered. The last example introduces another plane problem that follows Naghdis solution on infinite wedges. For this, a new analytical solution is presented for plane stress state using von Mises yield criterion with a uniform shear loading along the boundary. R-, h-, and combined adaptive procedures are demonstrated on the above examples. Since exact stress fields are known, the norm of the difference between numerical and analytical solutions is used as the measure of error. ","Configurational mechanics, presented by Eshelby in the early fifties, is widely used in several areas of theoretical continuum mechanics and computational mechanics (see [8,10]). One of these applications is the configurational force driven finite element mesh refinement. Since these error configurational force vectors point in the direction of increasing total potential, moving the nodes in the opposite direction yields the optimal mesh structure. A closed-form solution to this problem has been derived by Hill [6], and it can also be found in the literature, e.g., Chakrabarty [3], Lubliner [12]. The second example analyses an infinite plate with a circular hole loaded by biaxial tension. In the wedge problem, the stress state depends on a single variable in cylindrical coordinate system. However, the presence of a singular point at the corner of the wedge makes this example excellent to demonstrate adaptive methods. In this section, the governing equations of the configurational force are recapitulated for linear elastic and elasticperfectly plastic material models at small deformation. The equilibrium equation can be written as                                                     (4)                                                           div                                                                                             +                               f                               =                               0                               ,                                                                           where                          f                       denotes the physical body (or volume) force. In this section, the concept of the configurational force driven mesh refinement is presented. The nodal results obtained from adjacent elements are averaged. This expression is only applicable on free degrees of freedom; which means that the boundaries of the model have to remain intact during the mesh reconfiguration. When the value of this norm exceeds a required limit, than it is necessary to refine the mesh around the nodes in question. Here three numerical problems are presented to demonstrate the adaptive schemes described earlier. In the third test problem, an infinite wedge subjected to shear loading along one of its edges is examined, plane stress state and von Mises yield criterion are assumed. The finite element solution is carried out by using a single row of quadratic and axisymmetric quadrilateral elements. The difference between the two quantities indicates the error of the mesh. Attempts towards the generalization of the problem also occurred [11]. These values yield a proper elliptical plastic zone around the hole. In the finite element analysis, linear, four noded quadrilateral elements are used. The error of the stress tensor along a given path with uniform and h-adaptive mesh refinement is shown in Fig. This requires more computational effort but the results are better in accuracy with relatively low element number. Different mesh configurations used by different adaptive techniques are shown in Fig. Plane stress condition and von Mises yield criterion are assumed. This indicates that the duality of the shear stress seems to be compromised. 12                         ) that is more suitable for the given problem. CONCLUSION   This work demonstrates r-, h and rh-adaptive finite element mesh refinement methods based on numerical configurational force computation. The computation of nodal error configurational forces is slightly different from the purely elastic case. However, application of this method requires more computation time since the optimal nodal configuration can only be achieved through iteration and it is necessary to solve the original problem in each step. The stresses in the elastic zone are computed according to [1].",0.673289183222958,0.2375389408099688,0.3511811571836422,0.08008658008658008,0.20441988950276244,0.11508553250234022,0.24187725631768953,0.536,0.3333333290481672
9,9,S0168874X14001607," The higher-order gradient plasticity theory is successful in explaining the size effects encountered at the micron and submicron length scale. Due to the incorporation of spatial gradients of one or more internal variables in these theories and the associated non-classical boundary conditions, special types of elements in the finite element method maybe necessary. This makes the numerical implementation of this higher-order theory not straightforward. In this paper, a robust but straightforward numerical implementation of higher-order gradient-dependent plasticity theories is presented. The novelty of this paper is in (1) the application of the meshless methods, particularly the moving weighted least square method, combined with the finite element method for the numerical computation of plastic strain gradients, and (2) the numerical implementation of different types of higher-order microscopic boundary conditions at internal/external surfaces, interfaces, and moving elasticplastic boundaries. The proposed numerical implementation algorithms can be easily adapted in the implementation of any form of higher-order gradient-dependent constitutive models. Examples of applying the current numerical approach is demonstrated for capturing mesh-objective shear band formation and size effect and boundary layer formation in thin films on elastic substrates and metal matrix composites with embedded elastic inclusions through the consideration of stiff, intermediate, and soft interfaces. ","There are numerous experimental results that indicate a size-dependent mechanical behavior of materials at the micron and submicron length scales, in the sense that smaller is stronger. A critical overview of higher-order gradient plasticity theories as of 2004 was given by Gudmundson [30]. 39] for small and large deformation problems and for polycrystalline and single crystal plasticity. Although higher-order gradient-enhanced theories have provided many useful results, their numerical implementation is not straightforward, which is one of the most difficult tasks that hinder the wide use of such theories in solving various engineering problems. The application of MMs is exploited to analyze the gradient plasticity theories [53,54]. In the staggered approach, two levels of computation are introduced; outer (global) and inner (local) levels. In this approach, the nonlocal consistency condition is transformed into a linear set of algebraic equations that depend on the material parameters and the current coordinates of the integration points (here we call them nodes). Another issue with MMs is the sensitivity of results to certain parameters such as the nodal spacing and distribution, the order of approximation polynomials, and the size of domain where the interpolation function is defined (the domain for defining the interpolation function for each node was introduced as a super-element in Abu Al-Rub and Voyiadjis [45]). To the authors best knowledge, this approach has not been presented before. By introducing the moving weighted functions that control the impact of neighboring points (i.e. using the MWLSM), one can obtain more stabilized solutions. The layout of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, a summary of the main equations of a simple higher-order gradient plasticity theory is presented. Section 3 focuses on the numerical discretization issues of the gradient-dependent constitutive equations by applying the MWLSM to the nonlocal plasticity yield condition and the surface/interface yield-like condition. Also, the application of the implemented method is shown for simulating several unit cells with hard circular inclusions with special emphasis placed on the effects of higher-order boundary conditions at free surfaces and interfaces. There might be a domain                                                                                                                                                                            r                               i                               g                               i                               d                                                                            where the plastic deformation is suppressed in this region (e.g. a rigid inclusion or an elastic material with a higher yield strength). Moreover, only interfaces where one of the interacting phases is elastic are considered in this paper. 9) for p requires the satisfaction of the higher-order boundary condition in Eq. ( Therefore, the novel part of this paper is to propose a numerical algorithm to solve those two equations numerically using MWLSM without the need to use expensive higher-order elements when using the finite element method. In this Section, we switch to using the tensor notation for convenience. The application of MWLSM for solving the gradient-dependent plasticity model has been shown thoroughly by Pamin et al. [ Therefore, special care should be considered when applying the boundary conditions in MMs. The parameter                                                             in Eq. ( Note that one retrieves the LSM by setting                                                               =                               0                            . It is noteworthy that the weight function can provide C1-continiuity or higher as it also ensures the higher-order continuity of the interpolation functions in the MWLSM. As mentioned in Section 1, unlike the FEMs interpolation function, continuity is controlled by the continuity of weight function only and this can be another reason for selecting the exponential type of the weight function expressed in Eq. ( To highlight the differences between the LSM and the MWLSM,                             Fig. This means that their values are varied based on the type of the differential equation and the density and spatial distribution of nodal points. In order to calculate the gradients of the plastic multiplier, Eq. ( 4 shows for the current MWLSM the geometrical representation of the interpolation function and its corresponding first- and second-order gradients with respect to x-direction that are calculated using Eqs. ( The nonlinearity of governing gradient-dependent yield and interfacial conditions, Eqs. ( 52) in order to solve for                                                                                   within the plastically deforming bulk of the material. The results for two different triangular meshes (400 and 800 elements) are presented for both classical plasticity and the gradient plasticity. 7 shows the deformation patterns for the two meshes when using the classical plasticity and the gradient plasticity. This figure shows that the gradient plasticity gives mesh objective results. The solution is now mesh independent and the localization zone are to a great extending independent of the mesh density when compared with the local model. For the classical model the shear band width decreases by mesh refinement which results in a higher plastic strain value. The bottom surface of the film is held fixed and shear displacement                                                               u                             is applied to the top surface in the x                            1-direction. The only non-vanishing plastic strain component is the shear strain                                                            . The analytical solution for this example using the current strain gradient plasticity model is presented in the Appendix A.

The plastic strain gradient and GNDs density are maximum at the film-substrate interface, whereas the plastic strain is zero there. 16(b) for                                                                                                                                                                                                                1                                                                                                =                               5                            . In this section, the current gradient plasticity model and numerical implementation are applied for predicting the particle size effect in particle reinforced metal matrix composites with special emphasis placed on applying the higher order-boundary conditions on the particle-matrix interface. 17(b) and (c) shows the corresponding unit cell that undergoes a displacement-controlled loading. 18(a)) where strengthening results from the load transfer from the metal matrix to the stiff reinforcing inclusion, strengthening also results from changes in the deformation mode in the matrix material near the inclusion-matrix interface due to the high strain gradient effect [1,76]. In this figure, one can also see that the plastic strain gradient effect changes the whole plastic strain distribution as compared to the results from classical plasticity such that the value of plastic strain reduces to zero at and near the inclusions interface due to dislocation blocking. 13) and the distribution of the Laplacian of effective plastic strain, respectively. It is seen that decreasing the unit cell size manifests itself more notably in the strain hardening response rather than at initial yielding. Also, this causes the stress to distribute more within the matrix material. This is followed by a local (inner-level) computation where the nonlocal plastic consistency condition subjected to the microscopic (non-classical) boundary conditions is solved by considering the effective plastic strain as a degree of freedom. However, one disadvantage of the employed numerical scheme is that one should be careful in selecting proper values for the numerical parameters associated with the moving weighted least square method in order to get a stable solution. The size dependency observed is related to gradient effect and by incorporating the interface energy. While the plastic strain has the zero value at interface due to dislocation blocking for hard interface in gradient enhanced model, this magnitude is high for the classical model and more confined within a small region near the inclusion. Therefore the solution depends on                                                                                     x                                                                                       3                                                                           .",0.8255659121171771,0.1363086731889634,0.2339853138192429,0.05273833671399594,0.2826086956521739,0.08888888623823517,0.14906832298136646,0.576,0.23684210199667813
10,10,S0168874X14001565," An Element-free Galerkin scaled boundary method (EFG-SBM) based partitioning algorithm is proposed for the 2D steady-state heat transfer analysis of cyclically symmetrical structures. The eigenvalue matrices of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system are proved to be block-circulant under a symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations can be partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm in term of computing accuracy and efficiency. ","As a semi-analytical method [14], the scaled boundary method (SBM) is more efficient than finite element method (FEM) for problems involving unbounded domain or/and local singularity [57], and has been combined with FEM [36], meshless local petrov-galerkin method (MLPGM) [7], or element-free galerkin method (EFGM) [8,9] to tackle with elastostatics or heat transfer problems. However, higher computing expense, mainly caused by an eigenproblem, is one of the barriers for the further application of SBM. Actually there was some previous work concerned with exploitation of the cyclic symmetry in elastostatics [1016,18] or heat transfer analysis [17], but it seems no report relevant to EFG-SBM. Discussion and conclusions from this study are given in Section 6. The coordinate  runs from the scaling centre towards the curve, and has values of zero at the scaling centre and unity at the curve. Two numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm. All geometric, physical properties and essential boundary conditions are cyclic symmetry with N=16. Tables 5 and 6 exhibit a comparison of computing accuracy with ANSYS (6960 nodes and 2181 8-node-quadrangle finite elements). The relative error of solutions given by the proposed algorithm and ANSYS is less than 0.015%. CONCLUSIONS   The purpose of this paper is to explore the cyclic symmetry to improve the computing efficiency for the EFG-SBM based steady-state heat transfer analysis for two-dimensional rotationally periodic structures, and the major contributions include                                                     a)                            The matrices of the eigenvalue and system equation of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system is proved to be block-circulant so long as a kind of symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system is adopted. =                         2                                                  /                         N                       was defined in Sect.",0.6758508914100486,0.210393541876892,0.3208936148114841,0.11904761904761904,0.36585365853658536,0.17964071485818786,0.23076923076923078,0.609375,0.33476394451325314
11,11,S0168874X14001590," This paper deals with the assessment of a refined sinus model for multilayered composite plates in the framework of severe test cases to highlight the interest and limitations of such an approach. The present sinus model is enriched by higher-order terms for both in-plane and transverse displacements, and layer refinement. This kinematics allows us to exactly ensure both (i) the continuity conditions for displacements and transverse shear stresses at the interfaces between layers of a laminated structure, and (ii) the traction-free conditions at the upper and lower surfaces of the plates. The number of unknowns is independent of the number of layers. A C1 6-node triangular finite element implementation is proposed, which does not suffer any numerical pathologies. First, the present approach is assessed on its capability to capture the steep transverse stress gradients occurring in the vicinity of free edges and is also compared with models available in the literature. Then, a highly anisotropic sandwich structure proposed by Meyer-Piening is also addressed for further comparison. ","Composite and sandwich structures are widely used in the weight-sensitive industrial applications due to their excellent mechanical properties, especially their high specific stiffness and strength. In this context, they can be subjected to severe mechanical loading. In the ESLM context, a simple way to improve the estimation of the mechanical quantities has been proposed by Murakami [2]: one function is added in each in-plane displacement to introduce the slope discontinuity at the interface between two adjacent layers. Excellent reviews have been made in the following articles [69] or in the most recent review proposed by Zhang and Yang [10]. These two configurations can be considered as representative test cases allowing to discriminate 2D models. Except the first numerical analysis of the PipesPagano problem provided in [12], which is based on a Finite Difference scheme and the work of Tahani and Nosier [17] based on a semi-analytical approach, most of the numerical reference solutions have been obtained by means of the Finite Element Method (FEM). The mixed approach of Pagano [26] has been also employed by Nguyen and Caron for formulating LW finite plate elements dedicated to the analysis of free-edge effects [28]. This is essential for thick structures and multifield problems. All interface continuity and boundary conditions are exactly satisfied for displacement and transverse shear stresses using the Heaviside function. In the present work, this refined sinus model is extended and assessed with respect to its capacity to capture stress concentrations. In order to develop a conform, efficient and accurate FE, Argyris and Ganev interpolations are used as in Polit and Touratier [36]. Furthermore, since Argyris interpolation is a polynomial of the fifth-order and Ganev interpolation of the fourth-order, the field compatibility for the FE approximations of the transverse shear strains is automatically fulfilled, avoiding the transverse shear locking. The study considers symmetric cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. U                             is the space of admissible virtual displacements. At this stage,                             6                                                        NC                            +                            14                          generalized displacements are included in Eqs. ( 3), continuity conditions on displacements and stresses must be imposed. 13), must be approximated and this will be described in the next section. The superscript h indicates the finite element approximation. [                                                                                             Q                                                                                                e                                                                                       ]                          is the elementary vector of dofs in global coordinates. Note that these boundary conditions can be managed automatically using a reference number. The comparisons will involve different refined kinematics models with the same FE approximation based on ArgyrisGanev interpolations [38,45,50]:                                                     SinRef16p                            present model with 16 unknown functions. Furthermore, reference is also made to the systematic work of Carrera and his Carreras Unified Formulation (CUF), see [5153]:                                                     ED4                            Equivalent Single Layer and Displacement approach, each component is expanded until the fourth order; 15 unknown functions are used in this kinematic. It is evident that the SinRef11p fails to capture the steepest gradient in the vicinity of the free edge. We can say that the steep gradient is captured by the two approaches. The SinRef16p is closer to the reference solution than the ED4 model. The same comment can be made for the variation of the transverse shear stress along the x                         2-axis at the bi-material interface, see Fig. Note that the maximum value near the free edge for the three approaches is under estimated but the accuracy of the SinRef16p model remains better than the two other ones. The high gradient at the bi-material interfaces is rather well captured by the present model even if the maximum value is under estimated. A strong discontinuity appears for the EDZ4 model while the traction-free boundary condition at the top surface is not fulfilled for the ED4 model. When compared with LW approaches available in the literature ([22,18,16]) shown in Fig. It involves a simply -supported rectangular sandwich plate submitted to a localized pressure applied on an area of 520mm. Note that this severe test case is not frequently addressed in open literature. It can be inferred from this table that the convergence rate is high, especially for the displacements and the maximum value of the transverse shear stress at the top interface. On the contrary, the accuracy of the refined sinus model is rather good far from the application of the pressure. Thus, it can be inferred from this example that the fulfillment of the continuity of the transverse shear stresses is needed again and improved accuracy of the results when compared with ESL theories involving the same number of generalized unknowns. The field compatibility for transverse shear strains is assured. Finally, the compromise between the computational cost and the accuracy is rather good.",0.7859744990892532,0.156482320942883,0.2610020308274089,0.045171339563862926,0.18471337579617833,0.0725907352653271,0.15240641711229946,0.5181818181818182,0.23553718657024794
12,12,S0168874X14001553," A modified interval parameter perturbation finite element method (MIPPM) and a reliability-based optimization model are proposed for the coupled structural-acoustic field prediction and structural design with uncertainties in both the physical parameters and boundary conditions. Interval variables are used to quantitatively describe all the uncertain parameters with limited information. The interval matrix and vector are expanded by the modified Taylor series. Compared with the traditional perturbation method, the proposed MIPPM can yield more accurate ranges of the uncertain structural-acoustic field, in which the higher order terms of Neumann series are employed to approximate the interval matrix inverse. The reliability idea is introduced to establish an interval optimization model relying on the satisfaction degree of interval. The uncertain constraints can be transformed into deterministic ones if given the confidence level. The proposed MIPPM is used to predict the intervals of the constraints, and whereby eliminate the optimization nesting. Numerical results about a 3D car are given to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm. ","In recent years, with the increase of peoples awareness of environment and requirement for comfort, research on acoustic behavior inside the cabin is becoming a challenging problem for the lager complex structures such as cars, boats and airplanes. The coupled structural-acoustic problem incorporates the mutual influence between the thin structure and acoustic field when the feedback of the acoustic fluid on the structure cannot be ignored [1]. In the high-frequency range, the response is very sensitive to small changes in the model, and thus the statistical energy analysis (SEA), introduced by Lyon and Maidanik in the 1960s [6], places great emphasis on the high-frequency response analysis by using time and space statistical information. In the literature [9], a topology optimization based approach was proposed to study the optimal configuration of stiffeners for the interior sound reduction. Traditional acoustic analysis has been conducted under the assumption that the physical properties and boundary conditions are deterministic. Hence, establishing effective numerical methods and optimization models for the structural-acoustic system with interval parameters has great significance both in theory and engineering. Firstly, finite element equations suitable to coupled structural-acoustic system are briefly presented. Therefore, the coefficient matrices M,C,K and load vector F in Eq. ( 7) become interval matrices and vector with respect to the interval parameter vector                                                I                      . Its accuracy for the non-linear function is also acceptable if the ranges of the interval parameters are narrow enough. For two interval numbers a                                               I                       and b                                               I                      , there are six positional cases as shown in                       Fig. 44) is treated as an optimization model with respect to the design variables x and Eq. ( Consider a complex coupled structural-acoustic system of a 3D car model as shown in                       Fig. Due to the material heterogeneity and measurement error, the structural material properties are all uncertain and supposed to have a 5% perturbation nearby their normal values. From the comparison between the relative errors, it can be observed that the accuracy of MIPPM in which the higher order terms are retained is much higher than the accuracy of FIPPM where only the first-order perturbation terms are considered. ,                                                                                                      T                                                                                                         4                                                                                                )                                                        T                                               .

By comparing the results with the traditional deterministic optimization, in which the safety factor is set to be =1.1, we can observe that the proposed uncertain optimization method can gain a better effect of mass reduction. Thus, the MIPPM can obtain more accurate response bounds and greatly reduce the huge computational cost of Monte Carlo simulation.",0.6633081444164568,0.217391304347826,0.3274621027144374,0.06388206388206388,0.16352201257861634,0.09187278747936689,0.17898832684824903,0.4423076923076923,0.2548476413274914
13,13,S0168874X14001589," This paper deals with modeling and model reduction methods intended to sandwich structures with viscoelastic materials. The modeling step is carried out by combining the First order shear deformation theory (FSDT) with the GollaHughesMc Tavish (GHM) model. The GHM model introduces auxiliary coordinates to take into account the frequency dependence of viscoelastic materials which, combined with the finite element method (FEM), leads to large order models. This paper focuses on the use of model reduction methods. The reduced models compared to the full model are illustrated by three numerical examples in order to outline the performance, the practical interest of these methods and their validity domains. ","The use of viscoelastic [1,2] sandwich structures [3] has been regarded as a convenient strategy for many industries such as aeronautics, marines and automotives. Several theories [47] were developed in order to approximate the displacement and the mechanical deformation of such structures. This method has a significant advantage due to its simple implementation and low computational cost. Some other researchers [11,12] have used the layerwise theory for modeling the sandwich structures. In addition, this theory is applicable to both thin and thick structures. Consequently, a model reduction should be applied to the augmented GHM model. It is a particular case of dynamic reduction method according to which the inertia associated with the slave coordinates is neglected; only master dofs are retained. However this method is limited by its validity domain [24,25]. However, these papers remain limited mostly to frequency domain analysis with major uses of the space state modal reduction method for model reduction. 28] and De Lima and Rade [29] used the modal reduction in their studies frequently. In this paper, both the theory related to the implementation of the FSDT theory combined with the GHM method and the theory related to its reduction methods are presented. There is no slip or delamination between the layers, they are perfectly bonded. The lamina are macroscopically homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. Besides, it offers the feasibility of easy implementation in many finite elements codes. The choice of this element is based on the investigations realized by Chee [30], which proved that this element provides an excellent performance for the modeling of composites structures, notably sandwich structures. Herein,                                                                                     N                                                                                       c                                                                            is considered equal to 3. Several approaches are presented in the literature to describe this behavior such as the anelastic displacement fields model proposed by Leisuture [32], Fractional derivatives models proposed by Bagley and Torvik [33] and especially the GollaHughesMc Tavish (GHM) model [13,14]. Hence, the GHM model can be developed for direct incorporation into the finite element method. considering initially constant moduli (                         E                         (                         s                         )                       or                          G                         (                         s                         )                      ). Thus, the coordinates of the reduced model are a subset of the full model. This is the most straightforward model reduction among the three categories. Guyan and modal in physical space reduction methods belong to this type of coordinates. This transformation takes various forms depending on the used reduction technique. The reduced mass, stiffness and damping matrices can then be written in the form of Eq. ( In practice, the modal reduction method leads to good accuracy results when the p first modes are chosen typically from 1.5 to 3 times the frequency band of interest. O Challahan [21,22] marked that this technique allows, after expansion, to return from the reduced model p exact solutions of the full model. In fact, the rank of a matrix is defined by the number of rows or columns linearly independent. The modal reduction in physical space method allows the derivation of a reduced model which is a subset of the original model expressed in physical coordinates. 4(a) and (b) are considered as the reference for the full GHM model. 8), which describes the shear modulus as a rational function as well as by Eq. ( 12)) has interest in time domain analysis while the frequency analysis can be carried out directly by the resolution of Eq. ( Then, the reduction process is applied and the reduced mass, stiffness and damping matrices as well as the external load vector corresponding to each reduction method are calculated. Hence, the two transformation matrices must have the same size to compare them such that the master dofs of the Guyan reduction method is equal to the master dofs of modal reduction in the physical space method. However, for the Guyan reduction method the optimal choice of master dofs is conditioned by the maximum of cutoff frequency. This time, evaluated for each reduction method, includes the calculations of the transformation matrix and the FRF response which is obtained by solving linear equations at each frequency point. For the clarity of comparison, it should be mentioned that all reduced models have the same size 830. Here both steady state and transient analysis are carried out. 13) is performed using Newmarks integration technique [37] with an unconditionally stable scheme. These comparisons are performed through static tools called temporal prediction indicators. Results comparison tools are based on the statistic indicator calculations associated with the full and reduced responses. In fact temporal moments are usually used to quantify a temporal signal in order to compare several transient responses [38]. The time responses for full and reduced models are presented in                                Fig. Here, the Guyan reduction method agrees well with the full model because the excitation frequency in which the sandwich beam is subjected is less than the cutoff frequency (                                  f                               <                                                                                                               f                                                                                                                  c                                                                                                      ). In addition, the relative error in central moment T and means square root D does not exceed 0.04% for the Guyan reduced model and it is practically equal to zero for the dynamic reduced model. Nevertheless, the dynamic reduction method preserves its capacity to reproduce the full steady state response in both cases, leading to affirm the performance of this reduction method in the prediction of the dynamic behavior of viscoelastic sandwich structures. This is confirmed by the values of the three central temporal moments. The comparison between reduced models and full model is shown in                                Fig. The obtained results for the viscoelastic sandwich plate are presented in                                Fig. 16 shows the frequency responses for the reduced models derived from modal and modal reduction in physical space methods compared to the full model. It can be observed that the two reduced frequency responses derived from modal and modal reduction in physical space are identical to the frequency response of the full model. This leads to confirm that modal and modal reduction method in physical space have the capacity to reproduce the original coordinates of the sandwich structures through a projection on the generalized coordinates as well as on the physical coordinates with good accuracy. This is clarified by the values of the three central moments (E, T, D) (                               Table 12.1), which is identical to those of the full model. Thus dynamic reduction method remains a good choice of reduction methods. So, when more than one structure is used and takes into account the non-linear behavior of the most structures, the use of model reduction method in the substructuring context or component mode analysis [36] for viscoelastic sandwich structures appears quite attractive. So, it remains challenging to develop an efficient reduction strategy that can overcome this problem. This is done by the addition of a non-linear term in the equation of motion Eq. ( The value of each used non-linear spring coefficient is                                                         =                                                                                             10                                                              9                                                                                    N                            /                                                                                             m                                                              3                                                     . Furthermore, the cutoff frequency of the viscoelastic substructure (SS2) is equal to 165Hz. Hence, this reduction method presents an efficient tool to handle non-linear structures with viscoelastic materials in time domain, which enables one to perform the frequency analysis with more specific techniques such as the harmonic balance method. CONCLUSIONS   In this paper, finite element procedures are combined to first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and to the GHM model for the modeling of viscoelastic sandwich structures. Consequently, model reduction methods have been proposed as a convenient alternative for this problem. This method allows a simple implementation in the most finite elements codes with a significant reduction ratio in terms of CPU time and a good capacity of prediction of the original model, especially in the substructuring context where the necessity of an efficient reduction method becomes twice reinforced first by the large systems dimensions induced by viscoelastic components and second by the consuming time generated by the introduction of local nonlinearities. Thereby, the projection on physical space is realized, leading to good results. However, this method needs an additional time compared to other reduction methods and requires verifying the minimum conditioning number condition.",0.9495091164095372,0.0683631222861759,0.1275443182910158,0.03816046966731898,0.38613861386138615,0.06945681047344089,0.0973630831643002,0.6666666666666666,0.16991150220089282
14,14,S0168874X14001875," Three models were developed to simulate the transfer of prestress force from steel to concrete in pre-tensioned concrete elements. The first is an analytical model based on the thick-walled cylinder theory and considers linear material properties for both steel and concrete. The second is an axi-symmetric finite element (FE) model with linear material properties; it is used to verify the analytical model. The third model is a three dimensional nonlinear FE model. This model considers the post-cracking behaviour of concrete as well as concrete shrinkage and the time of prestress releasing. A new expression from the analytical model is developed to estimate the transmission length as well as the stress distribution along the tendon. The paper also presents a parametric study to illustrate the impact of diameter of prestressing steel, concrete cover, concrete strength, initial prestress, section size, surface roughness of prestressing steel, time of prestress release, and the member length on the transfer of stress in pre-tensioned concrete elements. cross sectional area of concrete cross sectional area of prestressing steel internal radius of cylinder external radius of cylinder the nominal diameter of the prestressing length of small element in longitudinal direction Youngs modulus concrete Youngs modulus prestressing steel Youngs modulus eccentricity, which defines the rate at which the function approaches the asymptote average longitudinal stress in concrete at x concrete compressive strength after 28 days in MPa longitudinal stress in prestressing steel at x bond stress at x effective prestress (beyond transmission zone) initial prestress tensile strength DruckerPrager hyperbolic function of flow potential fracture energy ratio of the second invariant on the tensile meridian to that on compressive meridian transmission length number of mesh segments around the tendon radial pressure applied internal pressure in the radial direction applied external pressure in the radial direction hydrostatic pressure von Mises equivalent stress deformed nominal radius of the prestressing strands or bars nominal radius of prestressing steel bar internal radius of concrete cylinder which equals radius of steel bar after prestressing external radius of concrete cylinder age in days degree of temperature radial deformation at a radius equal r radial deformation of pre-stressing bar at the outer perimeter radial deformation of concrete cylinder at the inner perimeter position along the transmission length coefficient of thermal expansion change in temperature shrinkage strain Poissons ratio Poissons ratio of concrete Poissons ratio of steel initial equibiaxial compressive yield stress uni-axial compressive yield stress maximum principal effective stress uni-axial tensile stress at failure applied stress in the longitudinal direction tangential stress coefficient of friction angle of dilation ","The prestress force in pre-tensioned concrete elements is transferred from the steel to the concrete over a certain length, which is known as the transmission length. experimental tests are needed to estimate the transmission length [1]. Moreover, this study will develop a finite element model to understand the influence of different parameters on the prestress transfer. Section 7 presents a parametric study while Section 8 examines the assumptions used in the analytical model. The same concept was used to estimate the transmission length in pre-tensioned concrete element [9]. The slip of prestressing steel was considered in evaluation of the transmission length in the study of Bentez and Glvez [1]. The ANSYS FE package was also used to model pre-tensioned concrete beams and railway sleepers [14,15]. Concrete cracking and crushing were modelled using the concrete damage plasticity model proposed by Willam and Warnke [16]. Both approaches implement friction-based contact surface algorithms to model the interface between steel and concrete. In the first approach, the strand was modelled as a truss element that was embedded in the concrete embedment approach. Bond behaviour between steel and concrete was modelled using surface to surface contact element. The increment in the bar diameter imposes a normal pressure acting on the surrounding concrete. This pressure induces a frictional resistance, which acts against the shortening of the pre-tensioning steel and holds the bar/strand in tension (Fig. In other words; the stress contours takes a circular shape around the bar with nearly zero contours at the cylinder perimeter. 4 shows the solution procedure for the prestress transfer model. The mechanical resistance only contributes to bond when deformed steel bars are used. The compatibility condition at the interfaces between the steel and concrete must be satisfied. The pressure starts from a high value at the end and decreases to nearly zero after the transmission length. The third step, the prestressing steel is gradually released and a solution step takes place. However, there is a difference between the two models beyond the transmission zone. The general trend of these curves is consistent with the findings of many other researchers [8,9,12,17] and with previous experimental observations [7,9]. The presence of sliding in the entire transmission zone, Fig. However, this phenomenon can be conveniently modelled using 3D FE analysis considering concrete non-linear behaviour. The release of prestressing steel exerts radial compressive stresses and circumferential tensile stresses onto the surrounding concrete. The behaviour of concrete in tension was modelled as linear-elastic up to its tensile strength, which was taken as one-tenth of the concrete compressive strength. 32] to consider different strength evolution under concrete tension and compression. The typical value of the K                                                           c                             ratio for concrete is 2/3 [32]. The shrinkage of concrete is the change of volume due to loss of water. This is because the transmission length is calculated using the 95% AMS method, which means it is not a direct result from the model. 15) is defined as n                                                     p                          and was varied from 8 to 64. The estimated transmission length at n                                                     p                          equals 40 is just 1.8% below the one for n                                                     p                          equals 64. Therefore the use of n                                                     p                          equals 40 gives an acceptable prediction of transmission length at reasonable computational cost. In this step, the distribution of stresses along its length remains constant and equals the prestress magnitude (Fig. The presence of concrete cracks agrees to observations in the previous experiments [36]. The comparisons exhibit a good agreement between the model and experimental measurements. As an example,                                                   Figs. 19 and 20 show comparisons of strain data normalised by the average maximum strain. 20, the decrease of the slope of tendon stress (i.e. bond stress) can be related to the non-linear behaviour of concrete (i.e. bursting cracks), which is not considered in the analytical simulation. It can be clearly seen that the variability in measurement of experimental data and the number of measuring points between the two figures. 7] estimated the transmission length using the slope-intercept method. For this reason only the results from 3D FE model are compared. The same method was followed to estimate the corresponding transmission length of their specimens from the FE model. 9] the transmission length was estimated by predicting the transmission length at 95% of the average maximum strain (95% AMS), [5]. 9] gives an estimation of each beam at the end of releasing (live end) and the far end (dead end).The comparisons against 12 specimens (i.e 24 measurements) show a reasonable agreement. However, the 3D FE model completed in about 3h in one CPU compared to 5ms. These investigations were carried out on a large number of beams and took a considerable amount of time. It is found that the increase of concrete compressive strength reduces the transmission length and increases the effective prestress. The radial expansion of prestressing steel due to Poissons effect after the release of prestressing force is in direct proportion with the magnitude of the initial prestress. It is found that the transmission length decreases with the increase of the concrete cover (Fig. However, Den Uijl has reported no further reduction to be expected beyond 3d to 4d                          [8]. This contradiction can be attributed to the fact that their experimental observations were based on a comparison between various beams with different number of strands, and different concrete properties and shapes (i.e. rectangular and I-beams). 29 shows that pre-tensioned concrete elements with a rough surface tendon have a smaller transmission length in comparison to those with a smooth surface. Also the von Mises contours are plotted for the 200200mm2 beams with different concrete cover shown in Section 7.4 (                      Fig. In this case, also circular contours are observed around the tendon with different intensity. The developed 3D FE model was then used to examine the assumptions of the thick-wall cylinder model to simulate the prestress transfer in pre-tensioned concrete elements which was found to be reliable. The presented parametric study, based on the 3D FE model, provides useful information about the influence of steel diameter, concrete cover, concrete strength, initial prestress, section size, member length, time of prestress releasing, and surface condition of the tendon on the transfer of prestress force from steel to concrete in pre-tensioned concrete elements. The size of the element was found to have no significant effect on the prestress transfer  In general, the paper has drawn advanced numerical simulations to improve the understanding of the prestressed transfer in pre-tensioned concrete.

15,15,S0168874X14001838," Stokes, Darcy and solid mechanics coupling is a matter of interest in many domains of engineering such as soil mechanics, bio-mechanics, and composites. The aim of this paper is to present a robust iterative method to deal with this coupling for low permeability media within the framework of industrial simulation, and especially for composite manufacturing processes. Stokes and Darcy problems are solved using a mixed velocitypressure finite element using a mini-element formulation, and coupled together by the so-called BeaversJosephSaffman conditions through their interface. This fluid formulation is then coupled to a non-linear solid mechanics formulation in finite deformations using Terzaghis law at the pore level, and an explicit dependence of permeability with respect to porosity that is exactly computed from the solid mechanics kinematics. Then, those formulations are validated with test-cases and by the Method of the Manufactured Exact Solution (MMES) (Knupp and Salari, 2003[1]). Finally, a 3D curved transient example of application is presented. ","This paper presents an iterative method to strongly couple Stokes and Darcy flows, in low permeability media, with finite strain solid mechanics in order to deal with fluid seepage into and out from low permeability media undergoing finite strains. It is applied here to complex manufacturing processes for composites in an industrial framework. Stokes and Darcy coupling has recently been a matter of interest for many researchers in various domains of application such as bio-mechanics [4], environment (river flow) [5,6] or composite processing [2,3,7]. Then, the corresponding solidfluid mechanical formulation is seen as smeared-out and corresponds to poroelasticity which has been widely used and therefore developed in soil mechanics [1012] and bio-mechanics [13,4]. Second, the finite strain solid mechanics formulation will be exposed (Section 4) and coupled with the fluid flow problem (Section 5) and validated. 1                      , for the fluid flow one may split the whole domain                                                 to be studied, into two areas. In addition, it is chosen to control the tangential velocity jump with a drag coefficient  leading to the BeaversJosephSaffman [20] condition. Numerically, there are several ways to formulate the coupled problem. As for the Stokes equations, they are ideally solved using a mixed velocity/pressure formulation to ensure mass conservation. The first one is the TaylorHoods elements type (P2/P1 or P1/P0) [23,24]. In the present work, the mini-element is selected for its robustness and simplicity of implementation. Let us introduce the superscript h to distinguish the approximated fields from the exact ones. In Section 3, are presented an analytical validation of the coupled problem and an illustration of the MMES validation. The flows are solved individually, in an iterative scheme, until equilibrium is reached at their interface. It confirms the good implementations of the coupling methods. This method consists in building an analytical solution, that is then introduced into the analytical system of PDE to be solved, to deduce the corresponding source term. Convergence of the solution was studied and computed errors for pressure and velocity for the different mesh sizes are presented in Tables 1 and 2                                                   for Stokes and Darcy domain respectively. This formulation relies on a NewtonRaphson scheme to deal with those non-linearities. This porous medium is actually a biphasic medium constituted of fibers and fluid. The fluid/structure strong coupling is treated iteratively in a quasi-static context (see Fig. Let us notice that the updated Lagrangian scheme adopted for the solid mechanics problem permits us to use the quasi-Eulerian stress field to compute the corresponding Terzaghi stress tensor [2,3]. The non-linear finite strain mechanical problem (see point                          4                       in Fig. Then, the deformation is reflected by the porosity variation modifying the permeability                                                                                                                                                            K                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             of the medium. The permeability can be computed with any porosity dependent measurement or model. Using an analytical approach based on Airys functions (see Appendix A), it is possible to build a test case for Terzaghis principle which has an analytical solution in the case of linear elastic preforms. The behavior of a stack of UD, not preformed (G1157 tested by P. Wang), is much more flexible than a preform held in shape by an epoxy powder (industrial preforms), so deformations presented in the results are larger than the ones usually observed. Injection is represented by a pressure boundary condition of 1bar and the vent by a pressure boundary condition of 0bar. After about one minute, the plate is completely filled, the pressure is balanced in its extremities and the preform swells back to its initial thickness (see Fig. Finally, resin finishes impregnating the upper part of the T and the filling ends after 550s. Moreover, to fully meet industrial needs, thermo-chemical couplings must be introduced allowing us to simulate non-isothermal transient processes and an elasto-plastic behavior for the fabric that may be more realistic with respect to compaction experiments.

16,16,S0168874X14001735," This paper investigates several field transfer techniques that can be used to remap data between three-dimensional unstructured meshes, either after full remeshing of the computational domain or after mesh regularization resulting from an ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian or Eulerian) formulation. The transfer is focused on state (or secondary) variables that are piecewise discontinuous and consequently only defined at integration points. The proposed methods are derived from recovery techniques that have initially been developed by Zienkiwicz et al. in the frame of error estimation. Obtaining a higher order interpolation with the recovered fields allows reducing the inescapable diffusion error resulting from the projection on the new mesh. Several variants of the method are investigated: (a) either based on nodal patches or on element patches, (b) by enforcing the balance equation in a weak sense or in a strong sense or not, (c) by using first or second interpolation orders. A special attention is paid to the accuracy of the transfer operators for surface values, which can play a first order role in several mechanical problems. In order to take into account the constraint due to parallel calculations, a new iterative approach is proposed. All methods are evaluated and compared on analytical tests functions, both for the ALE formulation and for full remeshings, before being applied to an actual metal forming problem. In all studied examples, in addition to improved accuracy, higher order convergence rates are observed both for volume and surface values, so providing quite accurate transfer operators for various applications. ","For a large class of nonlinear problems, such as forming processes or highly heterogeneous loadings, the optimal mesh configuration continually changes throughout the deformation process, requiring successive mesh adaptations during the numerical simulation. In Lagrangian formulations, it is activated at each remeshing step. In literature, the oldest method used for P0 transfer is a direct P0 operator. 4,5] formulated a local-bound-preserving conservative transfer operator with 1st and 2nd order of accuracy. The main difficulty consists in computing the integration terms of the L2 norm with non-matching meshes. It is then believed that it is possible to reduce and control this loss of information by enriching the transferred field beforehand, in such a way that this enrichment can compensate for the inevitable loss. On the other hand, in the second approach of nodal recovery techniques [2,15,16,19], the P0 variables of the old mesh are first projected onto nodal points to build a continuous interpolation. The P0 variables at the Gauss points of the new mesh are finally obtained by employing the shape functions of new mesh. 2] formulated a nodal recovery based transfer operator and discussed the different aspect related to equilibrium conditions, consistency with the constitutive equation, geometric issues and diffusion of state variables between successive meshes. 19] modeled a quasi-static ductile crack propagation by using a nodal recovery based transfer operator. 24], clearly stating that consistency among field variables may be lost due to the fact that nonlinear relations between them are not carried over correctly by a linear transfer operator. In 1992, in the frame of error estimation, Zienkiewicz et al. [ This is the case of problems including discontinuities such as bi-materials. P0 transfer is the simplest transfer operator as discussed above. Therefore, this technique can be rather efficient, provided that the considered meshes are sufficiently refined with respect to the remapped fields. Therefore, in order to minimize diffusion resulting from usual transfer techniques, interpolation can be avoided through a direct calculation of recovered fields on element patches, as for instance in [27,29]. Element patches, P                                                     g                         , are built on the old mesh. Different polynomial orders can be used providing different orders of recovery. 6) (from second to first polynomial order and down to constant P0 interpolation). In this paper, these two strategies are combined in order to handle any kind of meshes: if the enlargement of the patch (a) does not provide an invertible matrix then the order of the expansion (b) is reduced. After transferring                                                       onto the new mesh and computing the equilibrium equations (in a weak sense), it is observed that the balance equation is not properly satisfied. For unstable problems like those encountered in fracture mechanics, these oscillations can trigger unexpected behaviors of the material. Therefore, several techniques have been developed in the literature to improve this issue. 29] have proposed a transfer operator that exactly preserves the equilibrium as well as the stress admissibility at the new Gauss points. 8),                                                       denotes any force field enforced on the domain. The method is called REEP2 (Recovery by Equilibrium in Element Patches with 2nd order polynomial expansion). It is not an issue within an ALE formulation where new Gauss points are usually located inside the element of the old mesh. For the transfer between non-matching meshes, this discontinuity can regarded as a weakness of the transfer operator. Matrix                                A                                                                                       k                             is not always invertible. When matrix                                A                                                                                       k                             is not invertible, the reason is the lack of information, in other words, the lack of integration points surrounding node k. To overcome this issue, while keeping the method accuracy and convergence rate, second order neighbors have been introduced, for instance in [37], as shown in Fig. This approach requires identifying a set of elements which contains not just the neighbor elements but also neighbors to the neighbor elements. 5 shows how first order neighbors can belong to only two processors while second order neighbors can belong to three processors. In addition, this approach increases further communications between processors so reducing parallel efficiency. A similar approach was successfully used in [37] where a lower weight was allocated to second order neighbors. In this case, regularization (27) is introduced to compute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     k                                                                                              for those remaining nodes. Consequently, the different elements of any node patch have great chances to belong to different processors (see Fig. They are carried out only once, after the parallel assembly over the different domains. When recovering the solution on a coarse mesh and having a steep gradient of the surface, recovered SPR solution is often found well outside the extremes of the fields. The  value is determined by the user according to the expected variations of the considered field. Same meshes of uniformly increasing number of degrees of freedom are considered. Its rate is equal or larger than 2 for all tested functions, but it also approaches the value of 3 for some functions. When looking at the convergence of highly non-linear functions, as the order of the function increases, the rate of Avg operator decreases much more than with SPR approach. It should be noticed that the SPR operator utilized with this benchmark is not exactly the SPR operator presented in Section 3.2 but its original and sequential version based on the extension of the nodal patch (using second order patches, see Fig. In fact, the P0 convergence rate is very low, particularly between the coarse and medium meshes, and to close to 0.5. ( b) Using nodal patches and extrapolation, the Least Square (LS) operator provides significantly better results. e) As expected, SPR and EPR operators have superconvergent nature; the errors vary in O(h                                                                              ) with  greater than 1. is close to 2 for first order methods and close to 3 for second order methods. ( In the ALE formulation, the transfer operation takes place at each time step. As discussed in Section 3.4, according to mathematics, these values are correct and only denote the coarseness of the mesh for the considered gradient. The difference between these two fields (top and middle) can be used to estimate the discretization error. The fineness of new mesh allows amplifying the remapping difficulties. For the transfer of stress tensor, the conservation of the balance equation is also shown to slightly increase the accuracy when it is enforced in a strong sense. Element patches shows quite efficient, but in this first version they do not provide a strictly continuous interpolation and they are not easy to implement in a parallel environment. It is observed that resulting accuracy and convergence rate are the same for surface and volume fields.",0.7715674362089915,0.1612903225806451,0.2668076940880706,0.0438871473354232,0.17721518987341772,0.0703517556121059,0.18089430894308944,0.5426829268292683,0.2713414596646342
17,17,S0168874X14001711," A three-dimensional meso-mechanical model to study the debonding of FRP-to-concrete is described and then verified in this paper. The influence of the width of the FRP on the load-carrying capacity is investigated to understand the debonding mechanism of failure in such systems. Numerical simulations show that the progressive debonding of FRP plate bonded to concrete occurring beneath the FRP plate can be divided into four stages: elastic-deformation stage, the elastic-softening stage, the elastic-softening-debonded stage and softening-debonded stage. The numerical simulations indicate the development of high stress/strain gradients at the interface as a consequence of the relative slip between the FRP and the concrete. With the increase of the width of FRP plate, the interfacial bond strength and the slope of the initial elastic deformation of the load-global slip of FRP-to-concrete increases, the global slip is lower when increasing FRP width at the same stress level, by contrast, the total ultimate interfacial slip decreases with the increase of FRP plate width, and the interfacial ductility of FRP-to-concrete and the utilization efficiency of FRP plate also reduce. The reinforcement efficiency of the bonding of FRP plate in strips is higher than that of the bonding of FRP plate as a whole. In addition, the bending stress is of significant influence on the maximum principal stress at the loading end and near the plate edge and the debonding of FRP-to-concrete starts in the concrete beneath FRP plate near the edge of FRP plates and loading end. Numerical results on debonding of FRP-concrete visually reproduce the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of microcracking in FRP-to-concrete and reveal the distribution patterns of stress and strain in FRP plate and concrete, which is in good agreement with the existing experimental results in laboratory. Numerical simulations show that the numerical approach in the present study provides a useful tool for enhancing our understanding of debonding failure process and mechanism of FRP-concrete and our ability to predict mechanical performance and reliability of these FRP plate bonded to concrete structures. ","Strengthening reinforced concrete members using fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) has emerged as an efficient method to address strength deficiency problems. However, the retrofitted members often exhibit brittle failure modes due to separation or debonding of the FRP composites from the members. The stress transfers from concrete to the FRP composite plate through the bond between the FRP composite plate and the concrete. One of the common testing methods is single shear test in which an FRP plate is bonded to a concrete prism or block and is subject to tension. Consequently, further understanding of the bond is essential. In the last decades, altogether twelve shear anchorage strength models including empirical models, fracture mechanics model [11] and design proposals [1214] have been advanced [15]. f                                                                                       c                                                                                                                                                                   is the cylinder concrete compressive strength. Initially, linear elastic FEM was employed to study the stress distribution in the bond interface. With a further investigation, more attention was gradually shifted to the nonlinear FE analysis of the concrete-to-FRP interface, aiming at the simulation of the entire debonding process. 19] presented a meso-scale finite element model and simulated the entire debonding process in single shear tests of FRP-to-concrete bonded joints by directly modeling the cracking and failure of concrete elements adjacent to the adhesive layer to avoid the use of interface elements. Each cubic element has 8 nodes with three degrees of freedom per node. The heterogeneity of the material is taken into account by assigning different properties to the individual elements according to the real material structure. A stiffness degradation approach that a micro-fracturing occurs when the stress of an element satisfies a strength criterion was employed. The degradation of the material properties after element failure was introduced in the model to simulate strain-softening and discontinuum mechanics problems in a continuum mechanics mode. It needs to be pointed out that, as the element sizes used for the plain concrete prism in the present numerical model are much smaller than the maximum aggregate size, a true meso-mechanical model requires the modeling of the meso-level internal structure of concrete, with the difference between the cement mortar and aggregate explicitly considered. The present model is, however, not intended as such a meso-mechanical model. Hence, the effect of microstructure such as aggregates, cement mortar and pores in the concrete is homogenized in the model. For FRP composite plate, the constant residual strength is assigned to be an extremely small value approaching to zero in terms of its full brittleness. In elastic damage mechanics, the elastic modulus of element may degrade gradually as damage progresses. Herein tensile stress shall be referred to as positive and compressive stress as negative for sign convention. When the maximum tensile stress is reached and beyond the strength of the element, the tensile induced damage of element occurs. t                                  u                                                                                     is the ultimate tensile strain of the element, which indicates that the element would be completely damaged when the tensile strain of element attains this ultimate tensile strain. 4) with equivalent strain                                                                                                                                               . When the MohrCoulomb criterion is met, the minor principal strain (maximum compressive principal strain)                                                                                                                                                                                              c                                  0                                                                                     at the peak value of minor principal stress is calculated. Therefore, the maximum compressive principal strain                                                                                                                                                                                              3                                                                                     of damaged element is used to substitute the uniaxial compressive strain                                                       in Eq. ( The unloaded element keeps its original elastic modulus and strength. That is to say, the element will unload elastically and no residual deformation is incorporated in the numerical model. 3) that the damaged elastic modulus is zero, which would make the system of equations ill-posed, therefore, in this model a relatively small number, i.e. 1.0e-05 by default is specified to the elastic modulus under this condition. In this model, a single AE event represents a micro-crack forming event to indirectly assess the damage evolution, and the AE energy release is related to the strain energy of element before and after its damage. Only when the maximum tensile strain of the damaged element attains a given ultimate tensile strain, the damaged element will become totally cracked. The material properties for the concrete, GFRP used in Specimens III-7 and III-8 are adopted based on the experimental data [8,45]. 2 shows the numerically simulated FRP debonding in the concrete, in which the debonded FRP above the concrete block is not shown to facilitate the examination of the debonding surface of the concrete block. It can be seen that the numerical simulations agree reasonably well with theoretical prediction and experimental observations [8], which illustrates that RFPA3D code is effective in simulating the mechanical behavior of FRP-to-concrete. The plain concrete block of nominal dimensions, length (70mm), width (50mm), and height (35mm) was used. The right side of the numerical model is fully constrained and the bottom of the numerical model is restrained to allow a horizontal displacement along the loading direction. At each step, the stress states in some elements may satisfy the strength criterion. The stress and deformation distribution throughout the specimen are then adjusted instantaneously to reach a new equilibrium state. It is needed to be noticed that there is a significant spatial variation in the axial stress in the FRP plate, where it is expected to be uniform for completely homogeneous material. 6 shows the final numerical failure result and an experimental result [45] about FRP bonded concrete is also presented. The increase of the width of FRP plate will reduce the ductility of the FRP-concrete interface and lead to the decrease of the interfacial slip during the softening-debonded stage, which is consistent with the existing experimental findings [50]. 8 that stress ratio decreases with an increase in width ratio. It is indicated that the strength of FRP plate with a larger width will be less utilized. Since the shear stress is the main bond stress in the FRP-to-concrete, the following stress analysis on the width effect of FRP plates in the concrete are discussed in terms of the maximum shear stress and the maximum tensile strain in the concrete near loading end. 12b shows the maximum tensile strain in concrete along the FRP plate longitudinal direction, which is similar to the distribution of the maximum shear stress with the exception of the peak of the maximum tensile strain is not in the concrete at the loading end (X=0), but in the concrete of about 2mm (X=2) from the loading end where tensile failure firstly occurred. Prior to the peak, the maximum shear stress and the maximum tensile strain in concrete beneath the FRP plate along the transverse direction are basically uniformly distributed. Furthermore, the greater the width of FRP plate, the lower the utilization efficiency of FRP plate is. The reinforce efficiency of the bonding of FRP plate in strips is higher than that of the bonding of FRP plate as a whole. In addition, the bending stress is of significant influence on the maximum principal stress at the loading end and near the plate edge. It is obviously inaccurate to study the debonding failure of FRP plate bonded to concrete by two-dimensional finite element analysis based on either plane stress or plane strain assumption due to the width effect of FRP plate and the non-uniformity of stress and strain in FRP plate and concrete. Based on the simulated stress and displacement deformation field evolution along the longitudinal and transverse direction of the FRP plate, the deformation distribution can thus be divided into three main zones: the unstressed zone, the stress transfer zone and the fully debonded zone. 51474051, 41172265, 51174045, 51222401, 51374049, 50134036 and 51128401), and Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China (N130501002, N120601002, N110201001 and N120101001) is gratefully acknowledged.",0.7522768670309654,0.1787491884873404,0.2888626580803244,0.0891089108910891,0.3358208955223881,0.1408450671079862,0.16996047430830039,0.5620915032679739,0.26100151388534154
18,18,S0168874X14001863," Meso-level finite element analysis (FEA) is a popular way to study the influences of meso-level structure of concrete (namely the aggregate, the mortar and the Interfacial Transitional Zone (ITZ) structures) on the macro-level properties. However, its been a huge challenge to mesh the ITZ structure in concrete because of the unique layer structure of ITZ, which is 1050m thick and rather small compared to the normal sizes of coarse aggregates. If ITZ were meshed by hexahedral elements or tetrahedral elements which were 1050m in all three dimensions, millions of ITZ elements would be generated and its impossible to perform FEA on such a huge concrete model. In the current meso-level FEA in the literature, ITZ is either represented by zero-thick interface elements or over-thick elements, either of which is far from the real dimension of ITZ, leading to big discrepancies between the numerical results and experimental results. In this paper a method to generate ITZ meshes called aggregate-expansion method (AEM) is proposed to generate wedge elements around 50m thick to represent ITZs layer structure. The total number of generated ITZ meshes is limited and acceptable in meso-level FEA for concrete. A digital concrete specimen is generated from CT images with ITZ meshes generated by AEM and effects of ITZ on the compressive stress/strain/displacement distributions of concrete were studied. The characteristics of stressstrain response of the digital concrete specimen under tension were also studied and compared with experimental data. ","Meso-level finite element analysis (FEA) is a popular and feasible way in studying the effects of mesostructures on the mechanical properties and durability of concrete, which is assumed to be a three-phase composite composed of coarse aggregates, mortar, and the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) between them. This will be super time-consuming and cannot be accepted in meso-level FEA for concrete. ITZ also has a great influence on the initiation of microcracks in concrete [11,12]. First get the geometrical center of each aggregate by averaging the x/y/z coordinates of all the surface nodes. 1(a)) composed of every pair of triangles on the original surface and on the new surface as well as the three lines connecting every pair of nodes are generated to represent ITZ around the aggregate (as shown in Fig. 1(b))) and get the new mortar element set (EleSet-mor-surf-new). In PPMM, the final positions of coarse aggregates are determined by simulating the packing or mixing process of aggregates in the producing process of concrete. A common shortage of RAM and PPMM is that the shapes and spatial distributions of coarse aggregates are not consistent with the real concrete specimens, thus CTIM is developed to generate more realistic digital concrete. 18] generated a two-phase digital concrete by meshing the reconstructed mortar and aggregate structures from CT images. However, because the ITZ structure was not considered and the model was too large for FEA, the corresponding accuracy of meso-mechanical analysis was rather low. The scanning interval was 1mm and totally over 200 images were obtained for each specimen since the scanning length was a bit larger than the height of the specimen. One of the CT image series is shown in                          Fig. 2, from which coarse aggregates, mortar and voids are clearly seen and distinguished from each other. However, the voids structure was not taken into account and was regarded as mortar in the reconstructing process for the convenience of meshing and further analysis, because hundreds of thousands meshes would be generated to represent the neighboring regions of the voids, which could result in dramatic time consumption in FEA. In addition, the aggregates with dimension around 5mm were regarded as mortars for the same reason. However, the adjacent aggregate surfaces would be connected to each other because of the reconstruction error. To get compatible meshes of the mortar and aggregate structures, only the mortar surface meshes was generated. The maximum mesh dimension and geometrical error were set at 5mm and 0.8mm, respectively, in the re-meshing procedure of the mortar surface and finally the quality parameter of all the triangles were higher than 0.2, satisfying the needs of generating tetrahedral meshes for ABAQUS. Perspective views of the mortar surface before and after the re-meshing procedure were shown in                             Fig. All the other elements belong to the aggregate which the first element belongs to can be found with this method. The three advantages are as follows,                                                     (1)                            Small model scale. The distributions of the minimum principal stress and strain (namely maximum compressive stress and strain) in the aggregates, ITZ and concrete were shown in                                                   Figs. 7 and 8, from which it could be seen that the stress and strain distributions were both complicated resulting from the geometrical complexity of the meso-scale structures, and that the average maximum compressive stress of ITZ was much smaller than that of aggregates, while the average maximum compressive strain of ITZ was much greater than that of aggregates because of the lower elastic modulus of ITZ. Especially for case 1, the relative error of elastic modulus was between 0.3% (E                         itz=0.5E                                                     m                         ) and 0.7% (E                         itz=0.7E                                                     m                         ) while the volume fraction of aggregates was 1.8% smaller than that in the experimental data. The average strain is obtained by dividing the displacement along the loading direction by the specimen height. The postfailure stress will go linearly down to zero after the material is cracked. 11(c) and (e)) and finally split the specimen into two halves (see Fig. The essentials of damage and failure process of concrete can be seen explicitly and clearly with AEM proposed in this paper. 2013CB035902), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no.",0.7033462033462033,0.2327512776831345,0.3497609626363739,0.07308970099667775,0.1981981981981982,0.10679611256822052,0.1962025316455696,0.4732824427480916,0.27740491755666663
19,19,S0168874X14001851," The arc welding process involves thermal cycles that cause the appearance of undesirable residual stresses. The determination of this thermal cycle is the first step to a thermomechanical analysis that allows the numerical calculation of residual stresses. This study describes the formulation of a 2D finite element with through the thickness parabolic temperature distribution, including an element estabilization procedure. The 2D element described in this paper can be used to perform thermal analysis more economically than 3D elements, especially in plates, because the number of degrees of freedom through the thickness will always be three. A numerical model of a tungsten arc welding (GTAW) setup was made based on published experimental results. Size and distribution of the heat source input, thermal properties dependent on temperature, surface heat losses by convection and latent heat during phase change were considered. In parallel the same setup was modeled using ANSYS software with 3D elements (SOLID70) to compare against 2D numerical results. The results obtained by 2D model, 3D model and experimental data showed good agreement. ","Welding is a fabrication process widely used in industry, being employed in various industries such as petrochemical, aerospace, automotive, marine and others. The fusion welding provides the union between two parts by melting and subsequent solidification of the welding areas. In the majority of analyses a twofold procedure is adopted: a pure thermal analysis followed by a mechanical analysis with the calculated temperatures [5]. 9] studied several simplification hypotheses in numerical welding models and compared the results with experimental data. They reported that, in most cases, the simplifying hypotheses lead to quite acceptable results. However, the most critical regions in the structure are precisely those close to the weldment fillet or groove commonly denominated heat affected zone. The quadratic nature of the temperature distribution is motivated by findings of previous works that point to parabolic through-the-thickness stress distributions [1113]. On the other hand, in-plane heat conduction takes place at a different time scale since, usually, distances traveled by the heat flow are at least one order of magnitude larger than heat flowing along the transverse direction. In the right-hand side two loading terms appear: internal heat generation and boundary heat exchange.

The question to be answered now is why the proposed element does not deliver accurate results. The answer is obtained by comparing the exact solution of the problem, Eq. ( However, in highly nonlinear problems, more elaborate schemes may be required that adopt the concept of relaxation. In the problems tackled in this work the Picard method has proven to be good enough. Different values of  lead to different time marching schemes. In general >0 produces implicit schemes but the only second order accurate is the CrankNicolson obtained with =1/2. There are several methods to take into account the latent heat. These methods are usually divided into fixed and moving mesh methods.

There are several averaging techniques that overcome difficulties of the direct use of c                                                     eff                         . 6, v is the welding speed, c is the characteristic radius of heat flux distribution and  is a lag factor that defines the position of the source at time t=0. The ellipsoid parameters a, b, c                         1 and c                         2 correspond to dimensions of the weld pool and can be obtained from experimental data. An application example of the developed element is shown in                          Fig. In this example the thermal properties were considered constant, making the problem linear: c=900J/kgC, =2700kg/m3 and k=237W/mC. The initial plate temperature is 0C and the convection coefficient h is zero on all surfaces. The model mesh is illustrated by                          Fig. The temperature history for the thickness located at x=0m and y=0.05m is shown in                          Fig. 14) was obtained with data of (T) and c(T) used in Depradeux. The latent heat was considered in the ANSYS software by inputting directly enthalpytemperature curve points. The greatest variations between the models occurs in the points near weld line, where there is a high gradient of temperature. This can be explained by the model of the heat source, which has a strong influence on the gradient of the weld zone. A numerical transient heat transfer analysis of a GTAW process was performed.",0.7129228100607112,0.1640391139493115,0.2667108982048413,0.03333333333333333,0.1144578313253012,0.05163043128913657,0.13529411764705881,0.4,0.20219779842048066
20,20,S0168874X14001887," The entire glass sheet forming process consists of heating and forming a glass sheet and cooling and tempering it afterwards. For the first step, the glass sheet is heated using a local radiative source and deforms by sagging. In the thermo-mechanical calculations, temperature dependent glass viscosity, heat exchange with the ambient air and radiative source effects should be considered. A two-dimensional finite element model with plane deformation assumptions is developed. Using the P1-Approximation, the formulation and numerical resolution of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) are performed on the glass domain as it changes over time to estimate the flux of the radiative body at each position in the glass. In the next step, the sheet is cooled. Narayanaswamys model is used to describe the temperature dependent stress relaxation and the structural relaxation. The RTE is again solved using the P1-Approximation to consider the internal radiative effects during the cooling. There is a discussion using the P1-Approximation and comparing the results to other existing methods for the temperature changes of the glass throughout the forming process, for the deformed shape at the end of the forming step and for the residual stresses after tempering. ","Glass is a semi-transparent material with highly temperature dependent mechanical and thermal behaviors. For specific applications, glass must be tempered to make it more resistant and safer. Only a certain part of the radiant energy corresponding to the opaque spectrum of the glass is directly absorbed at the surface [10]. This is why the method is valid only for optically thick glass. Furthermore, it was shown in [15] that, for glass tempering, using the Rosselands approximation produces vast errors in transient stress calculations. The exact method for taking radiation in glass into account is to solve the radiative transfer equation.",0.3120063191153238,0.6124031007751938,0.4133970829618213,0.07142857142857142,0.040229885057471264,0.0514705836256492,0.25333333333333335,0.17272727272727273,0.20540540058436826
21,21,S0168874X14001899," In the present work an aero-elastic model is presented to study flutter and divergence of isotropic plate wings. A finite element model is subsequently developed to apply the theoretical model and predict the performance of plate wings. A divergence analysis is carried out using the finite element model combined with the vortex lattice method for aerodynamic load calculations. The flutter analysis is carried out using a finite element model combined with the doublet lattice method. The aerodynamic model is coupled to the structural model using the shape (interpolation) functions of the finite element model. Static condensation is used to express the finite elements in-plane degrees of freedom in terms of the bending ones, hence reducing the number of the elements degrees of freedom per node to three. A MATLAB code is developed to implement the proposed model using three-node triangular finite elements. The present model is validated using benchmark problems available in the literature, and the effects of taper ratio on both divergence and flutter speeds and flutter frequency are studied.

Cole [1] developed a model to study the divergence of wings with high aspect ratios. The results showed that the divergence speed decreases with the increase of the forward sweep angle of the wing. The finite element model was built using four and eight-node quadrilateral elements. Shokrieh and Behrooz [3], studied the dynamic instability of a wing using NISA finite element program [4]. The results of the analytical analysis were compared with the experimental ones and showed good agreement. The finite element method was used to obtain the structure stiffness matrix, and the doublet lattice method was used for the aerodynamic analysis. The aero-elastic stability analysis was performed using Zaero software package [15]. Patil and Hodges [16] presented a theory for the aero-elastic analysis of highly flexible flying wing aircrafts. The aerodynamic analysis is obtained using a 3-D panel code while the structural analysis is performed using a finite element code. A MATLAB code is developed for the aerodynamic, finite element, and aero-elastic analysis which uses the shape function transformation to couple between the aerodynamic and the finite element models. Two Aero-elastic models are developed to study the interaction between inertial, elastic and aerodynamic forces. In the aerodynamic analysis the steady and the unsteady aerodynamic coefficient matrices are developed. There are various methods used to determine the aerodynamic forces on lifting surfaces. 1 shows a typical horseshoe-vortex representation of a wing plan-form.

The results are obtained for a straight isotropic wing with different sweep angles. It is seen that for forward-swept wings divergence occurs before flutter, and for back-ward swept wings flutter occurs before divergence. Second, the coupling between the aerodynamic model and the finite element model in the present work is performed using the finite element shape functions, which is expected to produce more accurate results compared with the infinite spline method used in Ref. [ In this section, the effect of taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds is studied, on a straight plate wing with different taper ratios as shown in                       Fig. It is clear from the results that increasing the taper (TR decreases) results in increasing the divergence speed, flutter speed and flutter frequency, which means better wing stability characteristics.",0.5607560756075608,0.322463768115942,0.4094652980365715,0.11970074812967581,0.19672131147540983,0.14883720459856994,0.24663677130044842,0.40441176470588236,0.3064066805304118
22,22,S0168874X14002005," In topology optimization of a continuum under multiple loading cases (MLC), if the magnitudes of loads are different obviously, it is hard to obtain a clear component to support the weaker loads. Such MLC are called ill-loading cases (ILC). A new method is presented to solve the layout optimization of a continuum with bi-modulus material under multiple loading conditions (MLC) by using a Q-norm weighting objective which is formed with the Q-norm of weighted structural compliances of MLC. The effects both of the value of Q and bi-modulus behavior of material on the final material distribution are studied. Both of validity and efficiency of the present algorithm are discussed numerically. Results show that the optimal bi-modulus material distribution of a structure under serious ILC can be found if using a small positive value of Q within interval of [0.1, 0.2] and the computational efficiency is very close to that of traditional isotropic material layout optimization. ","Layout/topology optimization is a powerful tool for the conceptual design of a structure/composite material. In practical engineering, such materials as concrete, cast iron, plastic and rubber, are used popularly. On the other hand, material replacement methods are also suggested [1116] in layout optimization of a continuum as the different behavior in tension and compression exists. Material replacement method [16] is adopted to solve bi-modulus stiffness design. And Q-norm weighting scheme is presented to solve topology optimization of a continuum under MLC. c                                                     w                          denotes the weighted structural compliance under N                                                     LC                          types of loading conditions. w                                                     i                          is the linear weighting coefficient. In their work, Q=2 was used and common MLC problem was considered. In reanalysis, the elastic matrix and the principal directions of material varies alternatively. Therefore, the modification of local stiffness is, actually, a further update of material amount in element. It means isotropic material can express the accurate constitutive law of the local bi-modulus under simple stress state. For volume constrained stiffness design, the sensitivity analysis of objective function is the major task. For the i-th loading condition, the mean structural compliance in Eq. ( f                                                     m                          is the modification factor of the m-th element for the reason of material replacement and is given in Eq. ( In numerical simulation, commercial software ANSYS [26] is adopted for finite element analysis. 8, the topologies in the left column are different from those in the right column. The initial design of structure shown in                          Fig. In the first loading condition, the concentrated force P                         1=1000N is applied on the center of top with the weighting coefficient of w                         1=0.5. 10a and b gives the optimal topologies of structure with isotropic material under single load case. It is found that the amount of material to support P                            2 in Fig. The topology optimizations were carried out on two groups consequently. Especially, in optimization of structure under higher forces, the effects of lower forces were neglected. For finding a common method to obtain the value of Q, dimensionless analysis is presented. For bi-modulus material, R                                                           TCE                            =0.5 implies tension modulus is half of compression modulus. 14 gives the final material distributions of the structure with different values of Q. From the figures we can find the width of the bottom of solid structure shrinks with the decrease of Q. It implies that the effects of P                            2 on the material distribution become stronger. In structure for bi-modulus material with R                                                           TCE                            =2.0, tension modulus is greater than compression modulus, and the amount of material under tension should be as higher as possible. 15 implies that the amount of material to support P                            2 increases when Q decreases. When Q=1, the component to support P                            2 is vague (Fig. Volume constrained stiffness design is considered and f                                                     v                         =0.4. As Q=0.1, the material with SED should be distributed as much uniform as possible. 18), the average CPU time for each iteration is 75.92s which is 19.24% higher than 63.67s. If higher accuracy is required, higher iteration number should be adopted. From above numerical tests, setting maximum iteration number to be 50 is reasonable. For the stiffness design with serious ill-loading cases (e.g., r                                                                 P                               =p                                                                 max                               /p                                                                 min                               100), the practical optimal design can be found as the value of Q is in the interval of [0.1, 0.2]; the interval of Q is actually suggested with respective to two factors, but not limited to the problems in the present paper. The lower bound of interval is determined by the practical requirements. However, if the value of Q is too close to zero, the difference between the load magnitudes will be covered, i.e., the importance of the components to support both of the weaker loads and the stronger is not clear.

23,23,S0168874X14001991," This paper evaluates various Finite Element (FE) models for the static and dynamic analyses of single- and multi-bay metallic box structures. Load factors are considered in the static response, whereas free vibration analyses are addressed to compare the dynamic performances. Different FE models able to include cross-sectional deformations are compared. These comprise solid (3D) and plate/shell (2D) models, which are obtained by using a general-purpose commercial software. Results related to a hierarchical variable kinematic beam (1D) formulation, which opportunely degenerates into classical beam theories with rigid-cross section assumptions (e.g. EulerBernoulli and Timoshenko), are also addressed. Displacements as well as axial and shear stress fields are compared for various loading cases. Regarding dynamic analyses, fundamental and higher-order natural frequencies by various models are computed and the Modal Assurance Criterion is used to compare the eigenmodes. It is concluded that refined models are mandatory to accurately describe the static and dynamic characteristics of thin-walled box structures. Classical and lower-order refined beam models show severe limitations in capturing localized stress/strain fields as well as local mode shapes. Nevertheless, the accuracy of lower-order models is improved as a consequence of the adoption for transverse ribs, which lead to more rigid cross-sections. ","Thin-walled box beams are widely used in many fields of the engineering and their major applications are those related to aerospace, civil, automotive and naval constructions. The analysis of this kind of structures requires the adoption for structural models able to foresee higher-order phenomena, such as elastic bendingshear coupling and restrained torsional warping [1] as well as 3D strain effects. However, the attention is focused on the analysis of box structures made of isotropic homogeneous material in this paper. Other approaches to the analysis of thin-walled box beams might be those deriving from the use of two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) structural theories, mainly plate/shell and solid finite element (FE) models, e.g. see [3032]. According to CUF, in fact, the kinematic field of 1D theories can be expressed as the expansion of generalized displacement variables on the cross-section via generic functions. Moreover, LE models have been recently used to carry out component-wise analyses of both aerospace [45,46] and civil engineering structures [47,48]. The related FE formulation is then developed and the elemental matrices are expressed in terms of fundamental nuclei. The notation assumed in this paper is hereinafter introduced. Classical EBBM and TBM beam theories can be obtained as special cases of the linear (N=1) TE model as shown in [35]. For instance, different cross-sectional meshes in the case of a square section beam are shown in Fig. The fundamental nucleus has to be expanded according to the summation indexes  and s in order to obtain the elemental stiffness matrix. The geometrical data are as follows: a=0.8m, h=0.2m, t=0.01m. In the first analysis case, the structure underwent a point load F                                                     z                         =500N at (                            a                            ,                            L                            ,                            h                            /                            2                         ). 5                         a, b. For the sake of clarity, in Fig. 5 the Lagrange nodes are not depicted; each rectangle represents an L9 element. In the last column of Table 1 the number of the degrees of freedom (DOFs) is also given for each model implemented. 7                          shows the axial stress component along one vertical edge at the clamped end according to EBBM, ninth-order (N=9) TE, LE, 2D plate and 3D solid models. Further comments arise from the analysis as follows:                                                           1. The increase in the order for TE models provides greater accuracy as Table 1 shows. Moreover, the computational efforts demanded by CUF 1D models are significantly lower than those required by the solid model. The cross-section discretization refinement for LE models is an effective method that leads to the 3D solution. 13                          shows the distribution of the shear stress at the mid-span cross-section along the vertical left flange. It should be underlined that:                                                           1. MAC is defined as a scalar representing the degree of consistency between two distinct modal vectors (see Ref. [ The following remarks can be made:                                                           1. Bending, differential bending as well as shell-like modes are detected by LE models in accordance with MSC                                      Nastran                                   2D and 3D models. The MAC matrix shows a perfect correspondence between LE and 3D models. However, modes 34 and 89 are exchanged between the two models. Two ribs were added at y=1.6m and y=3.2m to the box beam of the previous sections. The thickness t of the two ribs, which are made of the same aluminium alloy of the box except for the Young modulus that is ten times greater, is equal to 5mm. 18                          shows the deformation of the tip cross-section by different models. By comparing the results with those from the solid model, in fact, the error from both EBBM and TBM is reduced by the 20% with respect to the case with no transverse stiffening members. Lagrange-type models are able to deal with solid solution both in terms of stresses and displacements with a high reduction of DOFs. The first bending modes are correctly provided by these models. LE models are able to foresee the solid and shell solution with a significant reduction of DOFs. CONCLUSIONS   Various 1D, 2D and 3D FE models have been used in this paper for static response and free vibration analysis of box beams.",0.6671348314606742,0.202991452991453,0.3112722617367163,0.04145936981757877,0.13368983957219252,0.06329113562695102,0.13445378151260504,0.366412213740458,0.19672130754778624
24,24,S0168874X14002017," In this study, an effective p-version two-node mixed finite element is newly presented for predicting the free vibration frequencies and mode shapes of isotropic shells of revolution. The present element considering shear strains is based on ReissnerMindlin shear deformation shell theory and HellingerReissner variational principle. To improve the accuracy and resolve the numerical difficulties due to the spurious constraints, field-consistent stress parameters are employed corresponding to displacement shape functions with high-order hierarchical shape functions. The elimination of stress parameters and the reduction of the nodeless degrees by the Guyan reduction yield the standard stiffness and mass matrix. Results of the proposed element are compared with analytical, experimental and numerical solutions found in the literature. We can confirm a very satisfactory numerical behavior of the present p-version mixed element. ","of hierarchical high-order displacement functions and field-consistent stress parameters yield locking-free and accurate numerical results. The present element considering shear strains is based on ReissnerMindlin shear deformation shell theory and HellingerReissner variational principle. To improve the accuracy and resolve the numerical difficulties due to the spurious constraints, field-consistent stress parameters are employed corresponding to displacement shape functions with high-order hierarchical shape functions. Among these different methods, the finite element method is recognized as the most versatile approach. Grafton and Strome [11] firstly proposed the element modeled as a straight-sided conical frustrum and extended to the case of non-axisymmetric loads. The mixed finite elements based on multi-field variational principles can provide better convergence rates and accuracy in the stresses than the conventional displacement-based element. The high-order nodeless hierarchical shape functions in the displacement field are introduced to enhance the accuracy in the prediction of higher vibration modes. In the present formulation, symmetric mixed strain components are preserved as approximately equivalent [6]. The relationship between stress resultants shown in                       Fig. 3 shows the convergence characteristics of the present element for the first frequency parameter depending on the value of m, which denotes the order of shape functions in (10) and (15). 5 shows the second and third natural frequencies of the clamped-free cylindrical shell obtained by using four present mixed elements with                             m                            =                            1                            ,                                                        2                            ,                                                        3                         . It can be seen that the results obtained by using only four elements show satisfactory agreement with those of Luah and Fan [21] by six spline finite elements. Hyperbolic cooling towers are large, thin shell reinforced concrete structures which contribute to environmental protection and to power generation efficiency and reliability. The proposed mixed finite element converges rapidly as increasing the order of the shape functions to                          m                         =                         2                      , i.e. cubic displacement functions and quadratic stress resultant functions. The several numerical results demonstrate that the mixed element (                         m                                                  2                      ) proposed herein can be applied with credibility to treating practical shells of revolution efficiently.

25,25,S0168874X14001905," This paper presents a multiscale finite element homogenization technique (MFEH) for modelling nonlinear deformation of multi-phase materials. A novel condensation technique to relate force variations acting on the representative volume element (RVE)  involving antiperiodicity of traction forces at RVE corners  and displacement variations on boundary-nodes is proposed. The formulation to accommodate the condensation technique and overall tangent modulus is presented in detail. In this context, the effective homogenised tangent modulus is computed as a function of microstructure stiffness matrix which, in turn, depends upon the material properties and geometrical distribution of the micro-constituents. Numerical tests concerning plastic materials with different voids distributions are presented to show the robustness of the proposed MFEH.

Especially, the periodic assumption seems to be very accurate.

The micro-residual is computed in different ways depending on the constraint. The main novelty of MFEH lies in the way that boundary-node forces at the corners are condensed in order to achieve a macro-consistent tangent operator: anti-periodic boundary conditions in terms of traction vectors at the corners of the RVE leading to quadratic rate of convergence in the Macrostructure. The results on nonlinear materials  with voids in the microstructure  proved the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed MFEH.",0.7752941176470588,0.1009188361408882,0.1785917655257402,0.02575107296137339,0.1111111111111111,0.04181184363486286,0.13120567375886524,0.44047619047619047,0.20218578881304314
26,26,S0168874X14001978," In this paper, numerical modelling of isothermal solutal melting and solidification in binary systems is done using a new meshfree interface-finite element method (MI-FEM) where the implicitly represented liquidsolid interface is allowed to arbitrarily intersect the finite elements. A meshfree radial basis functions (RBFs) method is used for solving a distance-regularized level set (DRLS) equation such that re-initialization is completely eliminated and fast marching algorithms for interfacial velocity extension are not necessary resulting in a more efficient solution with excellent volume conservation. In the proposed method, intersection points between the mesh and the zero level set are used as meshfree nodes such that at the interface-embedded elements interpolants are constructed using meshfree RBFs ensuring both the partition of unity and Kronecker-delta properties are satisfied allowing for precise and easy imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBCs) on each side of the interface. A coupling of the MI-FEM with a new meshfree automata (MA) method is used to efficiently predict the microstructural evolution during solidification. Benchmark problems with strong discontinuities were solved where very good accuracy was obtained. The solute conservation and interfacial equilibrium equations describing solutal phase transformation in binary systems were solved using the newly developed method. Mathematical formulation and implementation followed by numerical results and analysis will be presented and discussed. ","Solutal phase transformation is an isothermal diffusion-controlled process such that under certain process parameters melting of the solid or, conversely, solidification of the liquid will occur. Therefore, it is not surprising that numerical modelling of the effect of process parameters on the interfacial kinetics during phase transformation is very essential. The complex topological evolution of the interface and handling of interfacial dynamics such as merging and splitting makes numerical analysis quite challenging. The main advantage of this Lagrangian approach is that imposing the Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBC) at the interface, as is often typical in sharp-interface solidification and melting numerical models, is easy since there will always be interfacial nodes that directly represent the interface. Advantages of the VOF method include easy handling of interfacial dynamics and their excellent volume and mass conservation properties [18]. It is important to note that since the interfacial evolution is now independent of the underlying mesh, a finite element formulation used to calculate the field variables must account for the inter-element discontinuities where the interface may arbitrarily intersect the elements. The (GFEM/XFEM) are practically identical methods [22] where the GFEM was adopted by the Texas school [21,23,24] and the XFEM was adopted by the Northwestern school [22,25,26]. Such elements are termed blending elements which have been shown to slow convergence if left untreated [27,28]. Specialized methods are often needed to avoid the parasitic behaviour associated with blending elements and a lot of research has been done to overcome problems associated with them [22]. However, this is never the case since the interface will always move even if the frequency of re-initialization was reduced to be done only every few time steps. In phase transformation, this issue is of significant concern since the parasitic interfacial movement is non-physical and unrelated to the physics of the problem. 39] proposed a semi-Lagrangian particle LSM where random weightless particles are imposed at a narrow band on each side of the interface. Also, there must be sufficiently large number of particles near the interface to ensure that correction of the LSF is done accurately. Shape optimization can be done by interpolating LSFs using RBFs as was done by Wang et al. [ Our goal in this work is to further develop this approach for tackling phase transformation problems. Since these points already lie at the zero level set at any time during the evolution of the interface, DBC can be applied exactly and easily as in the conventional FEM. The main requirement is that all support nodes must either belong to the same phase as that of the sampling point or the interface. This significantly facilitates handling of singularities such as those encountered during crack-tip analysis. As will be seen later, the RBFs will also play a major role in solving the LSF. For elements that are un-embedded by the interface, the original Lagrange shape functions of the element are used for interpolation. Generally, pure meshfree methods are often time consuming due to:                                                           1. a                                                     i                          and b                                                     j                          are unknowns to be determined. As the solute diffuses from the liquid to solid, the interface must migrate to ensure local equilibrium. 35] for computing the interface velocity profile for dendritic growth simulations. One approach for resolving this issue is to use a non-local smoothing procedure such as that developed by Ji and Dolbow [29] for computing the gradients on each side of the interface. For simplification, we will only consider the direct method for computing the interface velocity. Clearly, solving for curvature using conventional finite elements is troublesome due to the high order derivatives required. If additional accuracy is required, one can add nodes of immediately neighbouring elements to the adjacent elements. However, finite difference solutions are often constrained to structured grids. As a result, frequent re-initialization of the LSF is necessary to force the LSF back into a SDF. The diffusion term forces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          to 1 to maintain the signed distance property. The basic idea is to sweep the front ahead in an upwind fashion by considering a set of points in a narrow band around the existing front and to march this narrow band forwards, locking the values of existing points and bringing new ones into the narrow band. It was first developed by John Von Neumann in 1963 after a suggestion by Ulam [56] to study universal copiers and destructors. Cellular automata (CA) methods provide a framework to simultaneously study changes in the entire computational domain. The basic idea of CA for phase change studies is to mimic interface propagation by capturing transition from nearby liquid cells to the solid body according to certain criteria, or a rule, which governs the future state of a cell based on its current state and the states of its neighbouring cells, which can be a Neumann-type or Moore-type, in a square cell lattice. One of the issues of this approach is that there is no link between the CA grid and the finite element mesh. Clearly, this process would be very time consuming for complex more realistic 3D CAD models of actual components. However, since only the solid fraction is tracked, not the interface itself, curvature can only be roughly approximated using a counting-cell method such as that proposed by Nastac [64]. To clarify, during pre-processing, random MA points are generated inside all elements. During a simulation, only automata points within an embedded element and its immediately adjacent elements are set to a state of alive. Due to the localized implementation of MA inside the interface-embedded elements, searching for the nearest MA points is limited to only the MA points within the interface-embedded element and its adjacent elements only resulting in a more efficient implementation. How to efficiently generate random MA points inside elements and not require any searching algorithms to determine which element occupies an MA point. Algorithm2                            Generating random MA points inside a 2D 3-node triangular element. Diffusivity of the solute is assumed constant in both the solid and the liquid. Using the interface nodes generated in step 1 and the distribution of the LSF, compute interface curvature and velocity. GE-RBFs were used where the parameter  is varied from 3 to 0.01. This is consistent with the works by Driscoll and Fornberg [65], Fornberg et al. [ Failure to re-mesh to accommodate the location of the interface can result in severely deformed elements, resulting in singular or ill-conditioned matrices which does not guarantee a converged solution. To demonstrate this, consider a simple two dimensional plate with a centre hole and with an initial field variable distribution U=0. Solution to the simple transient diffusion equation was calculated using the proposed MI-FEM as shown in Fig. This shows that the proposed hybrid meshfree-finite element provides great flexibility in not only imposing the DBC easily and precisely at the interface but also provides greater flexibility in selecting the support nodes used for constructing interpolants and in significantly reducing the requirement for re-meshing as the interface propagates across the elements. This is because the Lagrange shape functions employed in the conventional FEM can be pre-determined and, as a result, are cheaply constructed. To demonstrate this, consider a simple 55 matrix corresponding to 4 total nodes and 1 interface node. However, our approach is simpler and more efficient in handling larger systems. In this section we investigate the LSF solutions obtained using the MI-FEM where the interface velocity is chosen such that it mimics growth of side branches. 103) is used as DBC at the interface nodes, the solution of the Laplace equation (79) is then computed to obtain the extended velocity V                                                     n                                                                              ext                         . We then solved the DRLS equation (77) (case A) where no re-initialization was done, and compared the solution to that obtained using the conventional LS equation (1) (case B) with re-initialization done every 10 time steps, for a total of 5 virtual re-initialization steps. 16                          where excellent agreement is observed. We attribute this to the frequency of re-initialization which has already been discussed in the literature [31,41] reporting that re-initialization tends to un-physically move the interface and over re-initialization tends to over-smooth the interface. The accumulated volume loss obtained by both methods is shown in Fig. The MI-FEM can be directly applied to 3D geometry as shown in Fig. 19                          for a relatively more complex initial geometry with an internal cavity. The exact solution of the curvature everywhere on the circle is simply                             1                            /                            R                            =                            4                         . We use a 2D structured grid and use the computed RBF interpolants at the meshfree interface nodes for computing the curvature and we compare it with that obtained using the conventional FDM. Additionally, our approach directly computes the curvature at the interface itself in a single step and its meshfree nature allows it to be used independently of the underlying mesh/grid. CONCLUSIONS   In this paper we have presented the meshfree interface-finite element method (MI-FEM) as a hybrid meshfree/finite element approach tailored specifically for handling phase transformation problems in 2D and 3D. The theoretical foundation of the MI-FEM has been presented where its main characteristics can be summarized as follows:                                                     1.

27,27,S0168874X14002224," The continuous surface cap (MAT 145) model in LS-DYNA is known by its elegant and robust theoretical basis and can well capture many important mechanical behaviors of concrete. However, it appears to be less popular than many other constitutive models in engineering application due to many material parameters involved in the model formulation which are difficult to calibrate. This study presents an effective calibration method to determine the material parameters for this model as functions of uniaxial compression strength and the maximum aggregate size of concrete according to formulas from CEB-FIP code and concrete test data from other published literatures. The obtained parameters can be conveniently used for occasional users with little or no information on concrete in hand. We further compare the predictions of stressstrain relationship in tension and compression under different confining pressures as well as hydrostatic compression by the model, and validate the model based on impact test of RC beams. Besides, the model is further compared against a similar model-MAT 159 in terms of model performance. The results demonstrate that the model based on the calibrated parameters is capable of offering reasonable and robust predictions. continuous surface (Schwer Murray) cap CSCM concrete concrete damage concrete damage REL3 (K&C concrete) geologic cap Johnson Holmquist concrete Pseudo tensor RHT Winfrith concrete equations of state triaixal compression torsion triaxial extension continuum damage mechanics damage energy release rate used by Simo and Ju [31] reinforced concrete three invariants of stress tensor Rubin scaling function in Eq.

Computer modeling has now been widely adopted as a cheap and effective way in assisting the design of (reinforced) concrete structures under those extreme loads. There have been a good number of constitutive models developed in the literature for concrete, with forms ranging from relatively simple to more sophisticated (see a recent review in [1,2]). The plastic volume strain is obtained from the equations of state (EOS), and the plastic volume strain increment is independent of the incremental flow rule (the PrandtlReuss flow theory). With a sound theoretical basis, the MAT 145 available in LS-DYNA can well capture those behaviors together [3]. On the other hand, a sister model-MAT 159 [3,14,15], with internal material parameters generation based upon the unconfined compression strength                                                                                     f                                                                                                                      c                                                                            of concrete, aggregate size and the units has been included in LS-DYNA since version 971. Strain softening and modulus reduction of concrete are modeled via an isotropic damage formulation in the model. The calibration work in this research is based on the units (mm, ton, s, N), the application can be extended to other units when the proposed material parameters are converted to other units according to the dimensional analysis results provided in                       Table 1, or FE models in other units are converted into ones in current unit through Precessor software i.e. ETA femb. Parameter                                                       is the coefficient of exponential function as shown in                          Fig. The results for different concrete grades are summarized in Table 1. Reasonably good fitting is observed as shown in                             Fig. The second one is marked by BC for the compaction part where the pore is being crushed out. 6), and X                         0 is the elastic limit subject to the hydrostatic load. It is known that the plastic volumetric strain expansion occurs in the shear failure surface according to an associated flow rule, while the plastic volumetric strain compaction occurs in the cap surface. 10a for                                                         =                                                        0                            .2                          (a typical value for concrete). 10b for                                                         =                                                        0                            .2                         . Existing experimental data shows that the peak strength attained during the direct pull and unconfined compression test is sensitive to the strain rate, which is also specified by the CEBFIP code [19]. In consideration of this,                                                         =                            0                          is suggested in this study. Evidently, the model predictions by the MAT 145 based on mesh size of 83mm (the same as the test length) match well with the pre-peak test data and show generally acceptable agreements for the post-peak response, whilst the predictions using the MAT 159 show appreciable discrepancies for both pre-peak and post-peak responses no matter what mesh size is used. The predictions by the MAT 145 are apparently higher than those by the MAT 159. Not presented here, a further prediction of the peak tensile strength by the MAT 72 show nearly identical values with those by the MAT 145 for different grade of concrete. Hence the MAT 159 may be not suitable for high strength concrete with                                                                                              f                                                                                                                                  c                                                                                                                   48                                                        MPa                         . long cylinders at three confining pressure of 0, 6.8959MPa (1ksi) and 13.79MPa (2ksi), respectively.

28,28,S0168874X14002133," This paper presents a novel approach based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and a simple first-order shear deformation plate theory (S-FSDT) for geometrically nonlinear analysis of homogeneous and non-homogeneous functionally graded plates. Owing to many advantages such as (a) the S-FSDT is free of shear-locking, (b) less one unknown for the S-FSDT as compared with the conventional FSDT, (c) the awkward C 1 continuity required for the generalized displacements is treated straightforwardly because of the nature of the higher-order continuity IGA method, the new formulation is thus effective in modeling the geometrical nonlinearities of plates. The S-FSDT is associated with the von Krmn strain for dealing with small strain and moderate rotation. Numerical validation is analyzed and numerical applications are considered. The obtained results are compared with reference solutions to show the accuracy and the effectiveness of the present approach. The effects of different boundary conditions, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, geometric shape, etc. on the geometrically nonlinear mechanical responses of functionally graded plates are investigated. ","Functionally graded materials (FGM) with high temperature resistance, wear resistance and corrosion resistance have been widely used in various engineering structures. It motivates us because of the higher-order continuity of NURBS basis and the effective formulation of the S-FSDT theory in saving one unknown variable compared to the traditional one. By this new approach, a C                      1 S-FSDT geometrically nonlinear formulation can be easily achieved, and more importantly, only four DOFs per node are required. At present, it has been successfully applied in many engineering applications, for instance, structural mechanics [1318], fracture mechanic problem [19], unsaturated flow problem in porous media [20], contact analysis [21], and structural shape optimization [22]. This new formulation makes use of all the advantage features of the IGA and the S-FSDT theory and it also can be utilized for other homogeneous or non-homogeneous composite plate structures. Geometric nonlinearity is accounted for in von-Karman strain sense including membrane-bending coupling. on the geometrically nonlinear responses of the FGPs are investigated.

For comparison purpose, this problem is also solved using the ANSYS finite element software package. In the following examples, the boundaries of the plate are denoted as simply supported (S), clamped (C), and free (F); the computational meshes of the square plate and the circular plate are the same as that shown in Figs. 10, it may be concluded that (1) the behaviors of the normalized center deflections for different ratios reveal a similar situation; (2) The center deflections rapidly decrease as the length-to-thickness ratio varies from 5 to 10; while the variations of the center deflections are small as further increasing the length-to-thickness ratio; (3) as expected, the center deflection of the plate asymptotically approaches to a constant value with increasing the length-to-thickness ratio. A similar deflection pattern as that for the square plate is observed.

29,29,S0168874X15000025," A hierarchical modeling of planar steel frames that is based on a weak coupling of shell and beam computational models is studied in detail. A shell finite element is used to compute failure response of a representative part of each column and each beam of a frame under consideration; elasto-plasticity, geometrical nonlinearity and material softening (along with a localization limiter) are taken into account. The computed results, which naturally include local buckling and/or localized material failure effects, are further incorporated into a beam inelastic stress-resultant constitutive model; the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation EulerBernoulli finite element is considered in this work. The designed beam finite element formulation can be effectively used for the failure analysis of the steel frame. Important issues of such weak coupling concept are presented and results of several numerical simulations are discussed. ","A hierarchical approach to structural modeling is advantageous in many engineering applications. In general, it involves coupling of a higher-level computational model with a lower-level one. The coupling can be done in a strong way; in that case, the finite element model of a frame consists of beam and shell elements, as well as of constraints connecting both element types in a consistent manner (e.g. [39,9]). An accurate yet fairly simple failure analysis of steel frames is of great practical interest. Under large loads, a frame member may undergo plastic deformations. Use the beam finite element, designed under (b) above, for an effective failure analysis of the entire steel frame; such an analysis is fast and implicitly takes into account localized failures of frame members.",0.4379014989293361,0.5183776932826363,0.4747542875566666,0.10833333333333334,0.10236220472440945,0.10526315289875289,0.3118279569892473,0.32222222222222224,0.31693988571172627
30,30,S0168874X14002212," This paper revisits the buckling analysis of a benchmark cylindrical panel undergoing snap-through when subjected to transverse loads. We show that previous studies either overestimated the buckling load and identified a false buckling mode, or failed to identify all secondary solution branches. Here, a numerical procedure composed of the arclength and branch switching methods is used to identify the full postbuckling response of the panel. Additional bifurcation points and corresponding secondary paths are discovered. Parametric studies of the effect of the rise, thickness, and boundary conditions of the panel on the buckling and postbuckling responses are also performed. ","Cylindrical shells are widely used in aerospace, mechanical, and civil engineering applications as structural components in aircraft, tanks, pipelines, and offshore platforms. These structures have efficient load-carrying capabilities but exhibit high risk of buckling failures. This approach ignores bending effects before buckling and usually overestimates buckling loads. Later, more rigorous buckling analyses were performed with the consideration of linear prebuckling deformations [58] and nonlinear prebuckling deformations [9,10], but did not focus on postbuckling responses. 36,37] found using the asymmetric meshing technique (AMT) that a bifurcation buckling in asymmetric mode exists before the first limit point on the equilibrium path. In this work, an arclength method combined with a branch-switching method [38,39] is used to perform the nonlinear buckling and postbuckling analysis of cylindrical panels. In Section 2, we briefly introduce the nonlinear buckling analysis algorithm. 1(a)); (2)                                                                                              z                                                                                                T                                                                                       q                            =                            0                         , indicating a bifurcation point (Fig. 1(b)); or (3)                                                                                     =                            0                          and                                                                                              z                                                                                                T                                                                                       q                            =                            0                          simultaneously, implying the coincidence of a bifurcation and limit point. In practice, limit points are indeed identified as points of zero variation in the load factor, but bifurcation points are not detected based on the above. Instead in this paper, several lowest eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness K are monitored when tracing the primary equilibrium path. Zero eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness indicate the location of critical points, out of which, those not already identified by                                                                                     =                            0                          are the bifurcation points. Finally, note that only conservative systems are considered in this paper. First, two directions are typically associated with one secondary path, as shown in Fig. P                                               C                       represents the symmetry plane perpendicular to the circumferential edge and P                                               L                       is the symmetry plane perpendicular to the longitudinal edge. In this paper, the full panel is modeled with 27-node solid elements, which are free of locking. 4                         (a)) and the obtained solution (solid line) is compared to the result from [35] (squares). The central deflection is the positive z-direction displacement of the center point of the panel (Fig. 4(b) shows the associated buckling mode that is symmetric to both center planes P                                                     C                          and P                                                     L                          (Fig. At this bifurcation point, the branch-switching method is adopted to switch to the secondary path. The AMT requires modeling the structure with an asymmetric mesh that has the same pattern as the corresponding bifurcation mode, typically not available but assumed when generating the mesh, which can lead to incorrect results. In this subsection, two other pairs of bifurcation points and secondary equilibrium paths are identified. 9                         (a) shows the three lowest eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness on the secondary equilibrium path 2. It can be seen that all eigenvalues are positive for the load interval 171.6173.8N, indicating that the equilibrium states in this loading range, represented by solid line in                                                      Fig. In all the following figures, secondary equilibrium paths are classified into three categories based on the types of asymmetric deformation modes obtained. We denote as path C an equilibrium path asymmetric to center plane P                                               C                       but symmetric to center plane P                                               L                       (Fig. The structure displays an initial softening behavior followed by stiffening. When the rise of the panel is increased, the structure exhibits limit-point buckling with one pair of load-limit points (Fig. The structure with this rise loses stability when the first limit point is reached. 11(d)(f) shows equilibria of cylindrical panels with higher rises that have two types of secondary paths. Thus, a robust numerical procedure, like the one recommended in this paper, which can reliably detect all critical points and obtain corresponding postbuckling responses including all secondary paths is necessary for performing a thorough buckling and postbuckling analysis of cylindrical panels. When a 3D solid element is used to model the cylindrical panel, multiple layers of nodes exist in the thickness direction. The number and location of bifurcation points and secondary paths are also very sensitive to the boundary constraint.",0.8550512445095169,0.1017776228651097,0.1819041113424882,0.03278688524590164,0.2,0.05633802574885946,0.11217948717948718,0.5147058823529411,0.18421052337728533
31,31,S0168874X14002121," This paper presents finite element implementations for the solution of gradient elasticity problems using the FEniCS project. The FEniCS Project provides a novel tool for the automated solution of partial differential equations by the finite element method. In particular, it offers a significant flexibility with regards to modelling and numerical discretization choices. The weak form of the gradient elasticity problem is derived from the Principal of Virtual Work. An equivalent mixed-type finite element formulation for the strain gradient elasticity problem is implemented in order to avoid the use of C 1 continuous elements. The complete methodology and source codes (python scripts) are provided. Numerical results are presented and compared with well-known benchmark examples, demonstrating the applicability of FEniCS for such applications. ","Cutting edge composite material technology is becoming more dependent on nanosize particles and/or nanostructural systems. To study nanocomposites, classical (local) continuum theories tend to be inadequate, due to the fact that local theories do not account for micro-structural length scales of the material. To study size effects in micro/nano composite materials, non-local/strain gradient theories currently represent one of the most attractive options as they provide a strong theoretical interpretation that converges to standard behaviours. The main difficulty of using FEM to solve strain gradient elasticity is the continuity requirement (C                      1 continuity). Establishing mixed formulations was also not an easy task in the past [9]. This flexibility makes FEniCS particularly useful for areas of research in which computational experimentation with different constitutive relations, different auxiliary equations and different regimes are of importance (as in the case of strain gradient elasticity). Overall, the user-specified equations and methods of discretization remain explicit while the generic finite element implementation details are kept under the hood. 2] presented a micromagnetic simulation code, Hoffman et al.

32,32,S0168874X15000049," The elastic contact problem, as implemented in some commercial software such as ANSYS, depends on the user choice of some parameters such as normal contact stiffness, penetration limit and contact algorithms. This work investigates the artificial neural networks (ANN) potential to predict the value of some parameters, avoiding the trial-and-error procedure to determine these values. Contact problems based on simple problems are used to train the neural network, so it can predict the normal contact stiffness for more complex problems. Some contact examples are evaluated, including the small end connecting rod contact problem, of great importance in automobile industry. ","Systems with several parts interacting together are subject to mechanical contact. and the contact algorithms in commercial software are very conditioned to the user experience with contact problems, where experimentation is the usual form to choose the contact parameters. In this type of process, the tools have restrictions in the allowed maximum stresses, hence the friction factor is an important design factor. Results of the contact region behavior may not be consolidated even for well known systems, as in combustion engines components. In [24], the results of the contact pressure in the connecting rod small end are not conclusive due to the discrepancy in the solutions calculated from different authors. The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to the estimation of contact stiffness, one of the main parameters of a contact problem in the commercial software ANSYS [1]. For convenience, these variables are simplified to K, u and f from now. In this case, the penalty coefficient can be interpreted as the normal contact stiffness, named in ANSYS by the normal contact stiffness K                                                     n                         . The contact penetration constraints can also be related to a specific parameter called TOLN. If penetration is higher than the established limit, the solution is considered inappropriate. The study of the ANN is inspired in the functioning of the human brain, which is very efficient to process information. Amongst some characteristics, high-complexity, non-linearity and parallel processing are brain features. 2                       represents a typical back-propagation ANN. The error is calculated only for the most external layer, therefore a rule that update all the weights for all layers must be implemented. Then, a backward step is executed, using a learn rule to update the ANN weights. In this case, the hidden layer neuron error is calculated recursively in function of the local gradient of the external layers. From this point, the contact stiffness no longer affects the contact pressure. The dimensions of the problem (2D or 3D) may increase the difficulties to determine the normal contact stiffness. Nevertheless, to build a training set from the original contact problem can demand huge amounts of computational time. There is a uniform distributed surface load on the block of 92.69MPa (total of 10,000N). The structure was modeled with 13,926 nodes and 2,760 finite elements (20-nodes each). However, the penetration results are distinct for each model. Table A1 shows the training set of the ANN without the factor f. The ANN of this example has 200 neurons in the first layer, 200 neurons in the second layer and 1 neuron in the third layer. 7                            (a) and (b) illustrates the ANN training for each input. Table 2                             shows the identification potential of the ANN to predict the normal contact stiffness factor of the 3-dimensional contact problem. 8                          represents a 3-dimensional contact problem of an elastic sphere in contact with a rigid surface where an analytical solution is known [10]. The correction factor for this problem is f=1.0, since it was assumed the same level of penetration for both simplified and original contact problems. This ANN has 600 neurons in the first layer, 200 neurons in the second layer and 1 neuron in the third layer. 10                            (a) and (b) illustrates the ANN training process, where both penetration and contact pressure variation are properly identified. Table 3                             shows the ANN results of the validation set. Good agreement is achieved between the prediction of the ANN and the expected normal contact stiffness factor. The model is discretized with 86,199 nodes, 7,199 20-node finite elements and 32,226 10-node finite elements. It is not possible to model a hole in a pin in a 2-dimensional, and a full pin does not represent the pin behavior correctly. The dashed lines illustrate the coupling between the upper and lower pin nodes. The ANN is able to identify different types of penetration and contact pressure variation correctly. The identified k                                                           n                             from the 3-dimensional problem is given in Table 6                            . It is expected higher solution times for higher k                                               n                       values. Table 7                       shows the used time to train each ANN.

33,33,S0168874X15000062," In [1], a definition is given of the most normal normal. This is the normal that minimizes the maximal angle with a given set of normals. The algorithm proposed does indeed compute a normal that verifies the previous property. However, this may not always be the most normal normal. The previous normal should have more appropriately been called the most visible normal. In the present work, an algorithm is designed to compute the real most normal normal, namely the normal that maximizes the minimum angle with the planes carried by the triangles surrounding a point. This normal is the optimal point normal for boundary layer mesh generation if it is in the visibility cone. The algorithm consists in computing the generalized Voronoi diagram on the sphere of the edges created by the intersection between the triangles and the sphere. Numerical results illustrate the method, and compare with the previous algorithm. ","Surface triangulations are used to describe surfaces in many computer applications. The algorithm proposed in the previous reference produces such a normal. For discrete remeshings, this provides a robust criterion to evaluate possible surface foldings [15,16]. Regardless of the local convexity or concavity, the same visibility cone is generated at the vertex. 2                       depicts the same configurations seen from the dual viewpoint. The normality concept inherits from a scalar product definition.",0.324295010845987,0.5828460038986355,0.4167256927377098,0.10144927536231885,0.05263157894736842,0.06930692619498117,0.23728813559322035,0.16470588235294117,0.19444443960744612
34,34,S0168874X15000074," Numerical simulation has increasingly become an effective method and powerful tool for performance-based earthquake engineering research. Amongst the existing research efforts, most numerical analyses were conducted using general-purpose commercial software, which to some extent limits in-depth investigations on specific topics with complicated nature. In consequence, this work develops a new shear wall element model and associated material constitutive models based on the open source finite element (FE) code OpenSees, in order to perform nonlinear seismic analyses of high-rise RC frame-core tube structures. A series of shear walls, a 141.8-m frame-core tube building and a super-tall building (the Shanghai Tower, with a height of 632m) are simulated. The rationality and reliability of the proposed element model and analysis method are validated through comparison with the available experimental data as well as the analytical results of a well validated commercial FE code. The research outcome will assist in providing a useful reference and an effective tool for further numerical analysis of the seismic behavior of tall and super-tall buildings. ","In recent years, research on seismic behavior of tall and super-tall buildings has become increasingly popular, due to rapid construction of this type of buildings and high frequency of earthquakes worldwide. Research to date indicates that numerical simulation is effective for nonlinear seismic analyses of such buildings [111], but most of the simulations were performed using various commercial finite element (FE) software packages. 11] used ABAQUS and LS-DYNA for nonlinear analyses of seismic capacity of buildings aimed at providing a guideline for practical designs. Despite these research efforts, limited work is available to examine and compare the existing numerical simulation results specific to super-tall buildings, which is a very important piece of information for validating the rationality and accuracy of these simulations. The primary reason of lacking such work is that a design agency or research institute can hardly be willing to purchase several commercial software packages with similar functionality. In addition to their high cost, the source codes of commercial software are usually unavailable, thus restricting further in-depth research and discussion on their internal mechanisms and functionalities. For earthquake engineering research, several open source programs are available including OOFEM [13], and IDARC [14]. As an object-oriented open source FE software program for numerical simulation, the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) (http://opensees.berkely.edu) [15,16] has increasingly become one of the most influential open platforms. This effectively aids other researchers in reproducing existing research outcomes and in turn making their own contributions. As described above, this research proposes and integrates a new shear wall model with associated material constitutive models in OpenSees. The selection of critical analysis algorithms and the determination of computational parameters are discussed in some detail. Vector r1 extends from the midpoint of Nodes 2 and 3 to the midpoint of Nodes 1 and 4. Different material properties and thicknesses can be assigned to each layer according to the size of the wall and the distribution of reinforcing bars, as illustrated in                          Fig. The nonlinear behavior of concrete cracking, crushing and aggregate interlocking is incorporated in the planar concrete constitutive model. In the multi-layer shell element, the axial strains and curvature of the middle layer are initially calculated; the strains of each layer are then obtained based on the plane-section assumption. Lastly, the internal forces are calculated using the standard numerical integration method. An appropriate, reliable and robust two-dimensional concrete constitutive model is required to cater for the complicated mechanical behavior of shear walls and core tubes induced by an earthquake. The analytical model for concrete proposed in this research is based on the concept of damage mechanics and the smeared crack model. Cracks are assumed to form when the principal tensile stress exceeds the specified concrete tensile strength. Once cracking occurs, concrete is then treated as an orthotropic material. Being simple in formulation, this analytical model also demonstrates a good stability in computation [21,22]. R is the transformation matrix and  is the angle between the global and local coordinates. The experimental and simulation results are compared in                          Fig. In consequence, the crack band theory is recommended and adopted in the following study of both shear walls and super-tall buildings. To compare the performance of the multi-layer shell element and the traditional fiber beam model for shear walls, both are used to simulate the rectangular, H-shaped and T-shaped walls. 33] is adopted to calculate the characteristic parameters of the unconfined and confined concrete. Based on the above, it can be concluded that the multi-layer shell element developed in OpenSees is capable of replicating the complex behavior of various types of shear walls. In modeling a super-tall building, the fiber beam element based on the direct stiffness method, i.e., the DispBeamColumn element in OpenSees, is adopted to simulate the beams and columns [35]. The absence of a graphical user interface (GUI) makes it difficult to establish and evaluate a complicated super-tall building model in OpenSees. The corresponding conversion relationship is illustrated in                          Fig. The entire model of Building 2N, including 8469 nodes, 9744 fiber beam elements defined by 8244 RC fiber sections and 4704 multi-layer shell elements defined by 177 shell sections, was initially constructed in MSC.Marc and subsequently converted to OpenSees. This is because MSC.Marc has been widely used in nonlinear analyses of tall buildings and adequately validated in terms of rationality and accuracy [16,18]. The inverted triangular distribution of lateral load pattern is adopted to initiate the pushover analysis using both software packages. Good agreements are evident between the MSC.Marc and OpenSees predictions. The Shanghai Tower is a 124-story multi-functional office building located in Shanghai, China. The corresponding PGA values for earthquakes with 63%, 10% and 2% of exceedance in 50 years are 35, 100 and 220gal, respectively. 51222804 and 51378299) and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No.",0.7963917525773195,0.1698113207547169,0.2799345358772297,0.049019607843137254,0.21604938271604937,0.07990867278444998,0.1630170316301703,0.5775862068965517,0.25426944628209514
35,35,S0168874X15000050," This work presents a finite strain quadrilateral element with least-squares assumed in-plane shear strains (in covariant/contravariant coordinates) and classical transverse shear assumed strains. It is an alternative to enhanced-assumed-strain (EAS) formulation and, in contrast to this, produces an element satisfying ab initio the Patch-test. No additional degrees-of-freedom are present, unlike EAS. Least-squares fit allows the derivation of invariant finite strain elements which are both in-plane and out-of-plane shear-locking free and amenable to standardization in commercial codes. With that goal, we use automatically generated code produced by AceGen and Mathematica to obtain novel finite element formulations. The corresponding exact linearization of the internal forces was, until recently, a insurmountable task. We use the tangent modulus in the least-squares fit to ensure that stress modes are obtained from a five-parameter strain fitting. This reproduces exactly the in-plane bending modes. The discrete equations are obtained by establishing a four-field variational principle (a direct extension of the HuWashizu variational principle). The main achieved goal is coarse-mesh accuracy for distorted meshes, which is adequate for being used in crack propagation problems. In addition, as an alternative to spherical interpolation, a consistent director normalization is performed. Metric components are fully deduced and exact linearization of the shell element is performed. Full linear and nonlinear assessment of the element is performed, showing similar performance to more costly approaches, often on-par with the best available shell elements. ","Finite strain plasticity and fracture simulations with finite elements (cf. [ 8,10]) are peculiarly demanding with respect to numerical efficiency, Newton iteration robustness and mesh distortion insensitivity. 14]), are suitable for smooth problems where the mesh distortion sensitivity is not a crucial factor and governing equations do not contain discontinuities. The set of obstacle problems for shells are the classical plate and shell benchmarks and extensions to finite strains. Testing elements in finite strains is also important since some instabilities have been found in the past (see [22] for a report with the Morley-based shell). For out-of-plane shear, we adopt a consistent version of ANS. The components of the body force vector are b                                                     i                         .

As in Simo and Armero [43] and Pian and Sumihara [37], fixed non-orthogonal coordinates are used to:                                                                                 Extend the notion of bending modes of a rectangle to a general quadrilateral.

36,36,S0168874X15000037," In this paper, the dynamic large deformation X-FEM method is presented for modeling the full process of dynamic ductile fracture based on a nonlocal damage visco-plasticity model. The effect of inertia is modeled using an explicit central difference scheme which is enhanced through the use of mass lumping, reduced integration with hourglass control, and numerical damping. The material nonlinearity and the flow stress dependency on strain rate, hardening and temperature are modeled with the JohnsonCook visco-plastic model. The micro-void nucleation, growth and coalescence are modeled macroscopically with an isotropic damage model. The localization phenomenon due to the damage and thermal softening is suppressed by using the visco-plastic regularization in combination with the nonlocal visco-plastic model. The large deformation and large strain formulations are implemented within the X-FEM framework to model the macro crack discontinuities using an updated Lagrangian approach. Crack propagation and crack direction criteria are presented and the issues relating to the combination of X-FEM with the damage visco-plasticity model are addressed. Finally, the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified through several numerical examples. ","Dynamic fracture is a branch of fracture mechanics that considers the fracture phenomena for which the material inertia becomes important. Inertia effect can result from dynamic loadings on a cracked body or from rapid crack propagation [1]. Observations show that the behavior of the metals under dynamic loading differs from the quasi-static condition. Phenomenological models, such as those presented by Perzyna and Duvant-Lions, are the most famous models in this category [2]. In consistency based models, the yield condition has a consistency condition like rate independent plasticity models; thus the stress remains on the yield surface. This issue simplifies the introduction of such models into the existing codes. The meshless methods such as the element free Galerkin method have also been used to model the ductile fracture [22,23]. Among various techniques, the partition of unity X-FEM method is the most desired one [24]. 26]; in contrast to the standard-FEM the mesh does not need to be confined to the crack body and hence the remeshing strategy is removed in the crack propagation. 39] and Broumand and Khoei [40,41] employed the X-FEM method to model the ductile fracture in equilibrium, low cycle fatigue and rate independent dynamic loadings. The adiabatic temperature rise, manifest itself by thermal softening which might lead to adiabatic shear band [42]. The implementation of dynamic central difference method is also discussed in this section. Section 3 is devoted to constitutive equations; first, the JohsonCook visco-plastic method is explained and then, the nonlocal damage visco-plastic method that is used to overcome the localization phenomenon is discussed. stands for the divergence operator and the derivatives with respect to the time are shown with dotted symbols. In this approach, the crack-tip always intersects an element edge and it is not allowed to be inside of an element. Consider an old crack as shown in                          Fig. In the dynamic explicit method proposed here, the main source of computational cost is the numerical calculation of internal force term t                         F at the Gauss integration points. As stated in the previous section, the large strain formulation allows the extension of infinitesimal formulation to large strain range. Due to dynamic nature of the process, there is no time for heat transferring through the conduction or convection, so the problem is considered as an adiabatic process. n                                                                                                                                                                                         0                                                                    =                                  0                                                                                    where 0                         n is the unit normal vector to the boundary surface 0. The main drawback of the above formulation is its computational cost. Another important issue in the solution of nonlocal phase is the numerical integration of Eq. ( The idea behind the method is that the crack grows whenever the whole length covering the new crack segment                                                                                                                                                                                              c                                                                                     is damaged. It must be noted that the weighted average value of damage parameter and the crack growth direction are computed on the initial (undeformed) configuration in the large X-FEM deformation analysis. The crack propagation process occurs in two stages; in the first stage, as the crack initiation criterion is met, a new crack segment is added and the element sub-divisions are performed which is followed by the data transfer process. 35) does not necessarily retain the nonlinear relationship that exists among the original state variables, i.e. stresses, strains and damage parameter, in the transferred state variables. Hence, the equation of motion and constitutive equations cannot be satisfied and the inconsistency can be caused in the solution. In this relaxation phase, the extra tractions at the new crack surface are removed with a few relaxation increments that were in a self-equilibrium condition at the old crack-tip. In order to illustrate the robustness of proposed computational algorithm, three numerical examples are simulated. The first example is the necking of a tensile specimen, which is a benchmark test in nonlinear computational mechanics. In these diagrams, the predicted numerical results are compared with those obtained from the ABAQUS program that shows a complete agreement for both loading cases. The predicted results are again in good agreement with those obtained from the ABAQUS program that illustrates the accuracy of proposed JohnsonCook model within the computational algorithm. 5, it can be seen that the plastic heat generation results in more softening behavior particularly at the necking stage. 8, the temperature contours are presented for both loading conditions. In the second part of the numerical simulation, the efficiency of non-local visco-plastic formulation is investigated by evolution of the damage and temperature, and the mesh independence of proposed computational model is studied. A ramped prescribed displacement of 1cm is applied at the left edge of the specimen in 0.001s, as shown in Fig. The numerical simulations are performed using four meshes with densities of 520, 1040, 2080 and 30120. 4; a mesh of 520 elements is used for numerical modeling, and the critical time step is set to t=108                         s. The problem is solved for n=1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000, and the corresponding forcedisplacement diagrams are plotted in                          Fig. The results are almost identical for n=1, 10, 100 and 1000, however, the solution becomes unstable as can be observed from unrealistic oscillations at n=10,000. In this case, the damage and temperature are only calculated at ten time steps during the whole process of the solution; it can be seen that for each time step that the damage and temperature are calculated, a jump appears in the curve and the solution becomes completely unstable at the final softening branch of the diagram. The plate is in plane strain condition with an initial temperature of 293K that is made from a steel alloy with the material properties given in Table 1. The characteristic length is assumed as                                                         =                            0.1                                                        mm                         . It is apparent that a region of strain localization emerges from the top and bottom notches, as shown in Fig. It is obvious that although some differences may exist the overall results are almost identical. 22(a), a comparison of the forcedisplacement diagram is performed between two loading conditions. 22(b), the crack trajectories are shown for two loading conditions on the deformed configuration; it is clear that the cracks propagate in almost similar pattern. In the second part of the numerical simulation, the overall performance of the specimen is investigated to the nonlocal characteristic length. An explicit central difference algorithm was employed in combination with the mass lumping, reduced integration with hourglass control, and numerical damping. The algorithm follows the general elastic predictor/plastic corrector scheme [43]. Consider that the strain increment tensor                                                                          is obtained from the finite element solution.",0.8089976322020521,0.1311580294305822,0.225722182773731,0.05159165751920966,0.2865853658536585,0.08744185787943329,0.11752577319587629,0.5533980582524272,0.1938775481306979
37,37,S0168874X15000104," This paper presents a topology optimization method for the frequency response of a multiphysics system involving fluidstructure interaction. The finite element analysis of the system is carried out based on the u s / p f formulation. The structural domain is governed by the linear equation of elasticity and expressed in terms of the displacement, u s , and the fluid domain is described by Helmholtz equation via the primary variable of pressure, p f . The coupling conditions are the equilibrium and kinematic compatibilities at the fluidstructure interface. The optimization procedure used in this work is based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO). Due to the binary characteristics of the BESO method of adding/removing material, the methodology proposed here circumvents some problems faced by the traditional density based optimization methods, especially concerning the fluidstructure interface during the optimization process. The proposed methodology can be applied to various engineering problems such as noise reduction in passenger compartments in automobiles and aircraft, and vibration control of submerged structures. Several numerical examples are presented demonstrating that the proposed BESO method can be used for the topology optimization of these kinds of multiphysics problems effectively and efficiently for 2D and 3D cases. ","In the past few decades topology optimization has been used to improve the characteristics and increase the performance of a wide variety of systems. Since then, many other studies have been carried out to develop topology optimization techniques for dynamic problems [1322]. In these works, the elastic structure is placed in an acoustic medium and both structural and acoustic domains do not change their locations. The solid domain is governed by the elasticity equation and the fluid domain by Helmholtz equation. The two separate fields are fully coupled by the surface-coupling integral in each step of the optimization process, which guarantees equilibrium conditions on the acoustic-structural interface. For the three-dimensional cases this feature leads to a significant saving on the computational time. In the weighted residual approximation of the structural domain, Eq. ( Herein, it is proposed that the extended BESO method can substitute the solid elements by fluid or void ones. 24); v                                                     i                          is the volume of an individual structural element, V                                                     f                          the prescribed final structural volume and nel is the total number of structural elements in the design domain. The sensitivity number is used in order to rank the elemental sensitivities on the design domain in the evolutionary procedure [49,37]. Zhang and Kang [50] calculate the objective function for the dynamic compliance in a frequency range using the KreisselmeierSteinhauser (KS) aggregated function and take sampling frequencies in the interval of interest. The procedure used here to smooth the sensitivity number is described in detail by Huang and Xie [33]. 2                         ) with length scale r                                                     min                          and centred in the ith element. In the case where the final volume is different from the initial volume, structural material should be added or removed until the target volume is reached. In the BESO method, the parameter ER indicates the percentage of the volume that increase or decrease in each interaction. In the update scheme, if a structural element must be removed, it is replaced by a void or a fluid element. After the topology update in the system, the interface coupling matrix,                                                                                              L                                                                                                sf                                                                                    , is calculated again considering all alterations in the properties of the elements. Thus, in the next iteration, the boundary between the fluid and structural domain are defined properly for the finite element analysis. Discretize the fluidstructure system using the finite element method, define loads and boundary conditions. Adding and removing elements according to the procedure described previously. For the optimization analysis, this example uses similar parameters for the geometry model and material properties of those used in [25]. In all cases, the initial guess design starts at 60% of the structural domain and the optimization process is conducted at a constant structural volume fraction. In the first case, the BESO method is applied to optimize the system considering the excitation frequency of the external load of =20Hz. After the sensitivity analysis if a structural element should be removed, it is replaced for a fluid element when it has at least one fluid element neighbour; otherwise, it becomes a void element. Thus, the design domain using this scheme presents only two phases at any time of the optimization process. 7                             shows the pressure distribution for the initial design and the pressure distribution for the two final optimized topologies considering the two different update schemes. For both cases the methodology is able to reduce the objective function in approximately 34%. In the bottom of the fluid domain is applied the boundary condition of p=0 and in the other external walls are applied the rigid wall boundary condition                             n                                                                                    p                            =                            0                         . The finite element mesh used has 129,240 four-node quadrilateral elements. The evolution history of the objective function is shown in Fig. 14                          for the initial and optimized designs. The interface between the domains can be modified during the optimization process. 17 for the initial guess design and for the final topology after the convergence. In the fluid medium, the rigid wall boundary condition is applied to all external boundaries. The material properties of the structural domain (steel) are the Youngs modulus of 200GPa, density of 7700kg/m3 and Poissons ratio of 0.3. And the fluid domain (mercury) has density of 13,600kg/m3 and the speed of sound in the media is 1450m/s. The initial guess design starts at 59% of the structural domain and it is considered that the final structure is restricted to 40% of the complete structural domain volume. 22                          with the sensitivity number distribution. The minimum value of the objective function is verified in the 33rd iteration. After the optimization process reaches the final prescribed volume, 40%, at the 40th iteration, the process continues until the 59th iteration at a constant volume when the convergence criterion is achieved. A new sensitivity analysis is presented for the coupled systems.",0.7509051412020276,0.1793807299775125,0.2895848839790284,0.059190031152647975,0.20540540540540542,0.09189842458003694,0.1632047477744807,0.46218487394957986,0.24122806631819413
38,38,S0168874X15000086," In this paper the correlation of deformation energy and critical buckling loads is examined. An advanced analysis technique is derived for the investigation of z-section frames typically applied in composite aircraft fuselage. This technique is verified through closed form solutions of z-section columns under quasi-static loading conditions. The method is applied to study the effects of flange width and laminate thickness on the critical failure modes of composite frames. Therein, the focus is on composite structural elements favourable for deformation kinematics in aerospace applications subjected to crash loads. ","Research and technology projects on aircraft fuselage pursue the application of lightweight materials to achieve improved structural efficiency. Due to the plastic deformation capacity of state-of-the-art metallic fuselage designs, those certification requirements are achieved almost naturally by the designs intrinsic energy absorption capabilities. Favourable deformation kinematics put loads on those structural elements in a beneficial manner during crash landing conditions. The investigations outlined in this paper therefore concern straight frames instead of curved frames. Following the recommended steps, see Section 5, any cross-section may be analysed when analytical formulae are accessible. The elastic restraints between the three z-section segments are regarded therein by analytical formulae. These formulae are derived for orthotropic and symmetrical laminates. Table 2                          contains the input parameters derived from these material properties and the subsequent stacking sequence [0/45/45/90/90/45/45/0]                            S                         . So far, this decision process neglects elastically restrained edges. The effect of elastic restraints is respected in the following equations, where the critical buckling load of the entire cross-section is determined. The verification example was purposely selected to suit these conditions. These boundary conditions were kept constant for all buckling analyses and explicit numerical analyses executed. The buckling load is provided in Table 3                         . The other modification is the conditioning by initial imperfections. In fact, 0.10mm geometric imperfection is approximately 3.7% of the shell thickness, which is well within the range of geometric imperfection proposed by Orifici and Bisagni [15] (shell thickness), Lindgaard et al. [ By applying nonlinear geometry, the buckling load is reduced by about 4% with respect to the linear buckling analysis. It was implemented in LS-Dyna for its computational efficiency [18]. For buckling analyses, a significant relation between the buckling load and the mesh density was not found. Although highly recommended by Rohwer [20], an experimental validation is not the goal of this paper. MAT54 allows for visco-plastic material behaviour by parameter adoption. However, visco-plasticity was not considered for this investigation. This section provides an approach for the review of quasi-static buckling analyses executed with the nonlinear explicit solver LS-Dyna. 5                          shows the buckling mode shape using explicit analysis. However, from the contour plot the axial displacement of the free end as well as the overlaying buckling pattern becomes obvious. Due to the application of initial geometric imperfection, the analyses feature the same mode shape which was obtained from the eigenvalue analysis in the first step. This is reported by Zhang and Taheri [12] to be of significant impact. The structural stiffness increases and higher loads were transmitted to the fixed end. 2) The reaction forces obtained should not vary significantly compared to the quasi-static loading rate. A mass or density scaling would increase inertia beyond physical limits. Concerning the result quality as well as the analysis duration, a 10mm edge length was selected as a compromise. In this case, classical engineering mechanics are applied and not outlined in detail. Eventually, the gradient tends to zero which marks the characteristic peak. However, modes III and IV were superposed by a local component as shown in Fig. The structural responses by means of force-displacement relations are included in order to highlight one important fact. The geometric dimensions as well as the laminate stiffnesses relate in such a manner that the buckling mode changes from two half-waves to four half-waves along the length of the z-section. The mode change towards distortional buckling is therefore not directly obvious from the curve. Another peak is present at                                                   =                         100                      . It marks the mode change from distortional towards lateral-torsional buckling (IV). The peaks along the energy curve coincide with the mode shape change occurrences. 7) appears to require the most internal energy compared to previous critical modes. This is an important point to consider when energy absorption capabilities and deformation kinematics are of interest. In the previous section, a framework for automated analysis and data processing was configured. The advanced analysis technique enables an investigation of critical loads and their corresponding deformation energy for various CFRP z-section frames. Recalling the analytics from Section 2.1, the flange and the web restrain each other elastically when buckling modes develop. BF42 denotes an overall flange width of 42mm, 21mm on either side of the web. Since the stiffening effect is reduced with respect to configuration BF42, the critical buckling loads are significantly lower as well. The critical buckling forces are above the two previous configurations. The buckling load increases significantly by approximately 15% from configuration BF28 towards BF42, considering the values at onset of lateral-torsional buckling. The internal energy decreases accordingly to about 65% from BF56 to BF42 and about 40% from BF42 to BF28. Effect of composite thickness: The effect of the composite thickness on the critical buckling load as well as the internal energy is investigated. 12                       shows the critical buckling loads across the slenderness ratio . Comparing the three responses, the buckling loads vary significantly with the composite thickness. However, this variation reduces for                                                   >                         60                      . The buckling forces of SEQ24 decrease to approximately 50% within                          60                         <                                                  <                         120                      . The peak at                                                   =                         90                       marks the onset of lateral-torsional buckling which, in contrast, develops explicitly. The deformation energy increases with increasing composite thickness. The development of critical buckling modes is affected, which prevents a generalised interpretation. Step 3: Apply the methodology to obtain the elastic deformation energy as well as the corresponding critical buckling loads. Once the framework is established, the proposed methodology may be adopted in order to obtain the necessary data on significant case studies. The findings of this investigation are summarised as:                                                     1. Deformation energy maxima are present when the mode shape changes. From a design point of view, increasing the laminate thickness is more effective compared to increasing the flange width, for the purpose of achieving a subcritical loading state. Using the methodology presented here, an analysis of curved z-section frames becomes viable.",0.9406099518459068,0.0811409581833287,0.1493955041803633,0.02591283863368669,0.2558139534883721,0.04705882185904092,0.09050772626931568,0.6507936507936508,0.15891472653844424
39,39,S0168874X15000116," An efficient approach is presented for optimal domain decomposition of finite element meshes in conjunction with k-median method and a meta-heuristic algorithm. A clique graph is used for transforming the connectivity of a finite element model (FEM) into that of the corresponding graph. Subsequently, to decompose the nodes of a graph or the meshes of a finite element model to k subdomains, k-median approach is employed. Then, for finding k medians of graph, a recently developed meta-heuristic algorithm, so-called Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO), and standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are utilized. The performance of these methods is investigated through four FEMs to minimize the cost of k-median problem. A comparison of the numerical results using the CBO and PSO algorithms indicates that the CBO is capable of performing better decomposition using smaller or equal computational efforts. ","Parallel processing has been widely applied to large-scale problem like the analysis of hydraulic systems, electrical networks and finite element meshes. An algorithm for optimizing the decomposed mesh can be considered as efficient if it yields subdomains that require an equal amount of execution time. In this method, a graph is associated to the connectivity property of the considered finite element. This algorithm utilizes simple formulation; and it requires no internal parameter tuning. A tree T of G is a subgraph which contains no cycle; a cycle being a closed path. Here d                                                     i                          and d                                                     b                          are displacements, and Q                                                     i                          and Q                                                     b                          are the force vectors corresponding to internal and boundary nodes, respectively. 6) and the corresponding modified load vectors are evaluated using Eq. ( It must yield a set of balanced subdomains in order to ensure that the overall computational load be as evenly distributed as possible among the processor. If we consider the nodal number as the variables; firstly the number of meshes in finite element will be high and therefore the search space becomes very large, secondly implementation of the algorithm with discrete variables is more difficult. Then, the nearest nodes from these coordinates are selected as the medians of the graph. Therefore, in this work the proposed optimization algorithm considered with continuous variables and the number of variables in optimization algorithm is 2k. This is done for two purposes: (i) to improve the positions of moving objects; (ii) to push stationary objects towards better positions. Obviously a CB with good values exerts a larger mass than the bad ones. 4(b), the better and worse CBs, i.e. agents with upper fitness value of each group will collide together. The topological properties of the finite element models are transferred to the connectivity properties of graphs, by the clique graphs (as defined in Section 2.1). A rectangular FEM for a rectangular plate, as shown in                          Fig. 6 shows the optimal subdomains of the FEM with different colors for the different values of k. The evolution processes of the best fitness value obtained by two algorithms for k=6 are also shown in                          Fig. The numbers of medians considered in this example are set as k={5 and 10}. The performance of both algorithms is tested on this model, and the results are depicted in Table 1. In the last example, the FEM of a circular plate with 2400 elements and one opening is considered,                          Fig. 6, 9, 12 and 15, the problem of finding the median of each FEM is achieved using the proposed method. The validity and efficiency of the proposed method are shown through four test problems.",0.6944140197152245,0.2093791281373844,0.321746714210207,0.03640776699029126,0.11811023622047244,0.055658623485118346,0.14919354838709678,0.42528735632183906,0.2208955185429272
