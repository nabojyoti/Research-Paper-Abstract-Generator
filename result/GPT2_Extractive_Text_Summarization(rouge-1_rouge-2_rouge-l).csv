0,0,S0168874X14001516," Topology optimization problem requires repeated evaluations of the objective function and design sensitivity in the design domain with various density distributions. A repeated computations in the optimization process, requires a large amount of computing time and resources. These issues have inspired the development of optimization techniques combined with a system reduction. In order to reduce the system, this study employs a system dynamic condensation method based on selected primary degrees of freedom. Based on a system reduction, this study performs a topology optimization to maximize the eigenvalue and linear summation of each eigenvalue. In the optimization procedure, mode tracking method, called MAC, is used to pursue target modes, and the design sensitivity is calculated by a method of the rigid body mode separation assuring the reliability of sensitivity regardless of the design variable perturbation size. Each result of the numerical examples based on the reduction system is compared to that of the full system. Through a few numerical examples, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can provide efficient and reliable results in topology optimization. ","Traditionally, the size and shape optimization has been the main stream in the structural optimization field. The definition of topology in mathematics stands for the invariant of spatial one-to-one mapping, which is continuous and includes the inverse mapping. developed topology optimization to minimize compliance in static problems [13]. Then, topology optimization for maximizing eigen-frequency has been studied by Ma and Kikuchi [4,5]. The optimization process of eigen-frequency needs many repeated analyses in dynamic problems. We propose for the first time a methodology of topology optimization combined with the dynamic condensation system. The reduction system has been applied to various research fields, such as eigenvalue analysis, sub-structuring schemes and structural optimization based on sub-domain [911]. Section 2 briefly introduces the construction of the reduction system based on the PDOFs. Section 5 presents the maximization of the eigen-frequencies of a beam and plate by the proposed optimization method. In the first step, the scheme selects the candidate area by Rayleigh energy ratio. In the second step, the sequential elimination method (SEM) [12] is applied to determine the final PDOFs. In the first step, in which the candidate regions for PDOFs are selected, the modified Rayleigh quotient considering the density of elements is evaluated to consider the void element in topology optimization. To obtain the Ritz vectors, an initial static vector                                {                                                                                                      x                                                                                                         1                                                                                                                                                                                                         }                             is calculated by static analysis as Eq. ( {                                                                                                      z                                                                                                         j                                                                                                         i                                                                                                }                             is the components connected with jth element in the ith Ritz vector. After removing SDOFs, the reduction system is obtained as Eq. ( Even if the homogenization design method has an advantage, which is relaxation of the concept and domain in the continuum field, it is hard to implement the computational program. On the other hand, because SIMP has the same essence as the homogenization design method: It is easy to implement the computational program. 10),                                                      j                          and w                                                     j                          denote the squares of the target eigenvalue and the corresponding weighting factors, respectively. If the value of the MAC is close to around 1, that means that {                                                     can                         } exactly satisfies the eigenmode shape of {                                                     ref                         }. The first term of the right side is the sensitivity of the eigenvalue regarding the design variable                                                e                      . Moreover, it would be highly efficient to employ the reduced system approach in a large-scaled eigenvalue problem [9]. 12) with respect to a design variable v, the sensitivity of the eigenvalue is given as Eq. ( This example maximizes the first eigenvalue and the second eigenvalue of the beam, respectively. The selected DOFs obtained from the second step are presented in Fig. The sensitivity of the eigenvalue is calculated by the ISAM which separates the rigid body mode from the vector field as evaluated in Section 4. It can be confirmed that the MAC value is located near 1.0 which means a high correlation during the whole 30th iteration. 9 shows the candidate area and PDOFs every 5-iteration when the second eigenvalue is to be maximized. Thus, the weighting factors are defined as w                            1=1.0, w                            2=0.4. After that, the reduced system based on IRS is constructed with the selected PDOFs. Compared to a full system, the reduction system can guarantee the same result of topology optimization as the full system does. Through the 60th iteration, the final optimal configuration is converged as shown in                             Fig. As a result, the proposed method provides a reliable result of topology optimization compared to that of a full system and saves the computing time due to the efficiency of the reduced system. In conclusion, the present study suggested a new topology optimization combined with a reduction method. Through numerical examples, it was demonstrated that the proposed method gives reliable optimization results and shows the efficiency in time cost compared to a full system.

1,1,S0168874X14001528," Accuracy and efficiency are significant factors in wave propagation and load identification of mechanical structure. By introducing modified Hermitian cubic spline wavelets on interval (HCSWI), a multi-scale wavelet-based numerical method is proposed. The present method can avoid the boundary problem of the original Hermitian interpolation wavelet. A modified Hermitian interpolation wavelet base can get transformation matrix, so the modified Hermitian wavelet finite element is proposed in this paper. Positive question-wave propagation and inverse question-load identification is verified by this means. The modified Hermitian wavelet finite element involves wave propagation and load identification in rod and Timoshenko beam which are obtained and then compared with results calculated by traditional finite element method (TFEM) and B-spline wavelet on interval (BSWI) finite element. The results indicate that the present method for wave propagation and load identification has higher precision and costs less time on mechanical structure. ","Wave propagation and load identification are the key subjects of intensive investigations in mechanical engineering over the years [1,2]. Thus, accuracy and efficiency are importantly and greatly required for finite element techniques when they are used in high frequency wave propagation simulation [9]. Gupta presented a time domain technique for estimating dynamic loads acting on a structure from strain time response [18]. In the present work, an effective wavelet numerical method is proposed based on wavelet bases of modified Hermitian cubic spline wavelets on interval [26] to analyze wave propagation and load identification of rod and beam. Clearly, both                       1 and                       2 belong to C                      1(R). The above-mentioned wavelets can generate a wavelet basis for the space                                                                                     H                                                                                       0                                                                                       1                                                                              (                         0                         ,                         1                         )                      . Besides that the first derivative of HCSWI is continuity, it is more suitable for analysis of beam, plate, etc. These features make HCSWI as a finite element interpolation function better than that of BSWI. 11); superscript p is the step number of time; and t stands for the time interval from the p1 step to the p step. 14) can be solved by interpolating u, u()=T                                                     e                                                  u                                                     e                         . The physical DOFs column vector of HCSWI axial rod element is shown in                          Fig. 8 shows the lifting scheme for the wavelet based numerical method. V                      1 is the initial scaling function space and W                                               l1(l=1, 2, j1) is the wavelet space. 31), only the sub-matrices C                                               x,y                      , (x=                      1                      ,,                                               j1; y=                                               l                      )will be calculated when the scale l is lifted to l+1 and other sub-matrices will be preserved. The dimensions of rods are as follows: length 1m, height 0.02m and width 0.02m, and the dimensions of beams are as follows:length 1m, height 0.06m and width 0.06m. 30 HCSWI wavelet elements at level j=1, 2, 3; 30 BSWI elements and 600 TFEM are adopted respectively. The results of scale at j=3 of HCSWI elements are close to that of 600 TFEM. The process is consistent with the actual process of wave propagation [5]. The second wave is propagated over the respond by the excitation signal at the middle side. 13(a) shows the left side wave propagation of rod with different scales of HCSWI. 13(b) shows the left side wave propagation of rod with 30 HCSWI elements, 30 BSWI elements and 600 TFEM, 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 have higher precision than that of BSWI elements in 4 order 3 scale of rod. The first wave propagation spread continuously from left to right, when it reaches the rod fixed end reversely. 16 shows the responses of different methods compared with Timoshenko beam on the left side and on the middle side, which is loaded on the left side and the middle at the same time. 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 have higher precision than that of BSWI elements in 4 order 3 scale of rod. A rod or Timoshenko beam model is divided into 30 HCSWI rod or beam elements, the actuation point locates at the left end with a sinusoidal signal with frequency 100kHz modulated by Hanning window and the actuation point locates at the middle with a sinc function form of wave with frequency 100kHz modulated of axial rod or Timoshenko beam. As the scale ascension of HCSWI, the precision of load identification is higher than that of low scale of HCSWI. Compared with the 600 TFEM, the accuracy of 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 is close to that of 600 TFEM, but time consumption is less than that of TFEM. The result of 30 HCSWI elements with j=3 is close to that of the exact solution. 20(b) shows the left side load identification of rod with 30 HCSWI elements, 30 BSWI elements and 600 TFEM. The precision of load identification is higher than that of low scale of HCSWI, as the scale ascension of HCSWI. HCSWI has the good performance of the lifting scheme observed when the wavelets are added step by step to realize multi-scale approximation of the rod and beam, but the ascending scale way of BSWI is more complex. It has vital significance in engineering that after correction, the FEM can identify the immeasurable load. Table 6 shows the left side and the middle side load identification error and time consumption of beam with different methods when the signal to noise ratio is 240dB. This table also indicates the increase of noise makes finite elements ability is reduced to identify load. Compared with BSWI, HCSWI has the prominent advantage of improving precision by adding the appropriate wavelet function, but the BSWI is formed to recalculate the function to improve the precision of the new scales from the original scale function.

2,2,S0168874X14001413," The topic of the paper is related to the macroscopic modelling of riveted assemblies for full-scale aircraft structures subjected to crash/impact loadings. Super-elements have been developed to model the rivet and its rupture. However, stress concentrations in riveted assemblies can also initiate cracks from hole boundaries that propagate to the next ones and can lead to the catastrophic loss of the airplane by dismantlement of structural parts. An hybrid-Trefftz perforated super-element has been previously developed by the authors. However, the hole boundary of this super-element is a traction-free analytical boundary, preventing any connection with rivet elements. As a necessary first step to make the connection with the rivet possible, it is proposed to formulate additional nodes on the hole boundary of the perforated super-element. However, increasing the number of nodes implies increasing the super-element interpolation functions series order. Their ability to accurately describe the strain and stress fields is evaluated. It is found that when the series order is increased, the mechanical fields are still well described, but are a little less accurate than lower order interpolation functions. This evolution is discussed and seems to be linked to the ill-conditioning of the system. The accuracy is however still sufficient for the formulation of a 16-node super-element featuring eight nodes on the hole boundary. ","Finite element analysis (FEA) of airframe under high velocity impacts hardly succeeds in representing the failure of the structure when it occurs in riveted joint areas. Most of the above-mentioned elements featuring geometrical discontinuities are hybrid-Trefftz displacement finite elements because, with this approach, complex mechanical fields near the defect can be represented without the need to mesh finely the area. Some of the authors of this paper developed a hybrid-Trefftz super-element featuring a hole to improve the riveted joints modelling [8]. Given that a higher order has to be used in the Laurent series, close attention is paid to evaluate the accuracy of the interpolation functions. Finally, the main features of the interpolation functions are discussed. The perforated super-element [8] is based on a hybrid-Trefftz displacement variational principle [28]. The boundaries S                                                     u                          and S                                                     t                          represent the prescribed displacement boundary and the prescribed traction boundary, respectively. The interpolation functions of this super-element comes from KolosovMuskhelishvilis formalism [19] to take account of the influence of the hole within the element. For the sake of conciseness, the perforated plate analytical solution calculated thanks to KolosovMuskhelishvilis formalism will be simply denoted KM solution in the forthcoming sections of the paper. This minimum number does not always guarantee a stiffness matrix with full rank. 1                         (a)), and to 8 for a 16-node perforated element (Fig. It has been shown that increasing the number of nodes means increasing the order of truncation of the series appearing in the interpolation functions of the super-element. 1(b)), it is proposed to study the interpolation functions associated with this super-element. The presented study assesses, more generally, these interpolation functions according to the series order. METHODOLOGY   The methodology presented in this section has already been used to study the interpolation functions of an existing 8-node super-element in which series are truncated to                             N                            =                            M                            =                            4                                                   [8]. Finally, the studied parameters are:                                                                                          The load case: uniaxial tension, biaxial tension, pure shear, simple shear. 8) set up a relationship between the number of parameters and the number of element nodes, it is at least necessary to collect data in eight points for                             N                            =                            M                            =                            4                         , and 16 points for                             N                            =                            M                            =                            8                         . Firstly, one can notice that, whatever the studied configuration for series truncated at order 4, the accuracy does not decrease (Table 1). This configuration is the less accurate among all those studied. It has been verified that changing the position of the data points around the perforation has no influence on the accuracy of the KM solution. Indeed, another analysis has been done with data points on the perforation rotated with an angle of                                                         /                            8                         , for example, and results obtained at order 8 for the configuration                             {                            8                            /                            8                            /                            8                            }                          are similar to those obtained previously (Table 1). The analytical expression of x-displacement, for example, for the three above-mentioned load cases is thus given by Eqs. ( The value of the condition number of the matrix                                                                                     A                                                                                       ls                                                                            is given in Table 3                       according to each configuration. The worst results are obtained for the configuration where data points are collected on the hole boundary (i.e., the configuration                          {                         8                         /                         8                         /                         8                         }                      ), which is the most interesting configuration for our problem. This phenomenon of sensitivity has already been subject of discussion in the literature, and has also been observed in recent works for Airy stress functions, but it has never been established for KM functions. Therefore, the theoretical formulation of a 16-node perforated super-element featuring eight nodes on its perforation (i.e., the variational principle and the stiffness matrix) will be presented in a future paper. The next step will consist in modelling the interaction between the fastener model and the perforated super-element.

3,3,S0168874X14001437," Automotive door sealing system isolates passenger compartment from water, dust and wind noise. It has the most direct influences on door-closing performance, which is determined by cross-section design in terms of its appropriate Compression Load Deflection (CLD) property. Traditional sealing structure has uniform geometrical cross-section. It has the shortcomings of bad fitting in corner parts with large curvatures, causing inaccurate door-closing effort design. Regarding the door panels complex 3D profile, numerical analysis and optimal design for new sealing with variable cross-section are developed in this paper. Firstly, the whole sealing is partitioned into several parts. For four nearly straight segments, conventional 2D numerical analysis can still be used to obtain desired geometrical configuration. For other four curved corner parts with large curvatures, 3D numerical analysis of door closing is applied. Secondly, 2D geometrical cross-section optimization is proposed. Instead of three variables in previous research, five variables are selected for featuring cross-section geometry and used for next CAD reconstruction with more precision. After comparison between Back Propagation (BP) neural network and the Kriging surrogate model, BP neural network which performs better and efficient in this automotive design optimization field is applied for extracting nonlinear mapping between five cross-section parameters and compression load, which were parallely optimized by Genetic Algorithm (GA) and its efficiency and accuracy are compared with another evolutionary algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thirdly, 3D numerical modeling of four curved corner parts closing process is realized, of which twisting and bending effects during seal assembly are taken into account, thus minimizing theoretical error and producing more realistic solution. Consequently, the desired geometrical configurations for both straight parts and corner parts satisfying designated CLD property can be obtained and the whole sealing can be achieved with variable cross-section, resulting in an ideal door closing effort. Finally, a Matlab-based platform has been developed to assist the design and optimization process. Experiment and case study indicates that it provides an effective method for new door sealing design with variable cross-section. ","Automotive door seals are installed in narrow gaps between door and body frame along the perimeters of the opening panels, as shown in                       Fig. However, better door-closing performance requires the opposite conditions [6]. For instance, 2D cross-section of the door seal is modeled and analyzed, making extraction of the reaction force and contact area conveniently [9]. Door seal is generally in the form of dual extrusion bulbs of metalloid sponge and dense rubber. Consequently, more cross-section geometrical parameters are required. Secondly, combination of experiment and numerical analysis is used to identify the hyper-elastic material model of door seal rubber. Thirdly, it solved the problem of cross-sections geometrical configuration and optimal variable selection. Based on Genetic Algorithm, cross-section parameters are parallely optimized. New door sealing needs variable cross-section so that it can bring about change in the CLD curve at different locations, thus satisfying the desired different compression loads and seal qualities. The whole sealing compression load required by good door seal performance is then distributed into each part. For four corner parts with large curvatures, 3D numerical analysis of door closing is applied, considering the bending and twisting effect caused by large curvatures and the pre-load effect of door sealing assembly process. Door seals use Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) sponge rubber. The testing process is shown in                          Fig. i                                                                                     are the principal stretch ratios. In terms of appropriate CLD property according to the distributed sealing compression load, geometrical parameters of four straight segments cross section need to be designed and optimized. In order to establish the implicit relationship between the section parameters and the CLD property, BP neural network is adopted to extract the highly nonlinear mapping mechanism with the help of Design Of Experiments (DOE) to provide sufficient training samples. Conventional method uses three simple variables of cross section height, rubber thickness and annulus diameter to describe seal cross-section. Five variables of angle , angle , distance d, associated with other two thickness variables, are proposed in this paper, as shown in Fig. Because of the irregular shape and hyper-elastic rubber material of door sealing, there exists strong nonlinear mapping mechanism between its input geometrical variables and output compression load, which are difficult to be expressed by the traditional explicit way. BP neural network needs sufficient training and learning samples. With the Design Of Experiments methods, the input of cross-section parameters is grouped as five variables and five levels, as shown in                             Table 2; orthogonal table is used to arrange the experiment samples and 25 groups of samples are numerically analyzed to obtain the output values of F                            1, F                            2, and F                            3. The upper fixture simulated the door sheet metal, while lower fixture as body frame metal. A three layers BP neural network is established to model the implicit mapping mechanism using large quantity of training samples learning. The number of the neurons of the hidden layer is chosen as 18, and other parameters are listed as the above content. It can be seen that the Kriging results match the simulated values a little better; however it is time consuming to choose a proper value for theta0, lob and upb, which means less efficient than BP neural network. The optimization efficiency is evaluated by the average fitness concluded from 50 calculations, and the comparative results indicate that GA can obtain a better average fitness as shown in                             Table 7, which means that GA performs a little better than PSO. The comparison of an optimal result and the original section size is shown in                             Table 9 and its corresponding compression load values are seen in                             Table 10. It can be seen that the rib structure matches the profile of upper panel perfectly. 20 illustrates the simulated results of the B-pillar seal with length of 82.24mm. Meanwhile, the dynamic compression load versus the door closing angle is extracted, as shown in                          Fig. 23 and 24 show its application for an engineering case study. 51275359), Project of Shanghai Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacture for Thin-walled Structures project (No.",0.5983952702702703,0.3044692737430167,0.403589676461151,0.07142857142857142,0.13953488372093023,0.0944881844974892,0.24561403508771928,0.4307692307692308,0.3128491573858494
4,4,S0168874X14001425," Multi-scale finite element (FE) modeling and analysis of engineering structures have become very necessary in order to provide both global and local structural information for a comprehensive assessment of structural safety. The multi-scale FE modeling needs FE coupling methods to combine mixed-dimensional finite elements, such as beam-to-shell and plate-to-solid, in a single structural model. This paper presents a new mixed-dimensional FE coupling method that can achieve both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium at the interface between the different element types. The principle of virtual work is first used to derive both linear force and displacement constraint equations for the interface. A numerical method compatible with commercial FE codes is developed to figure out the linear constraint equations which satisfy both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium conditions at the interface. The proposed coupling method is then extended to nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling problems. Finally, the proposed coupling method is applied to a number of test cases including linear beam-to-plate, beam-to-shell and beam-to-solid interface problems, a linear frame structure, and a beam-to-shell buckling problem. The obtained results are also compared with those from the existing methods. It reveals that the proposed coupling method can handle both linear and nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling problems more accurately than the existing methods and that it can be applied to a structure satisfactorily for multi-scale simulation. ","Finite element (FE) modeling and analysis of an engineering structure nowadays are a common practice to understand structural behavior and assess structural safety. Since different types of elements (beam, plate, shell, and solid) have different number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs), the multi-scale FE simulation needs a rational FE coupling method to combine mixed-dimensional finite elements at their interfaces into a single structural model. Broadly speaking, there are two major coupling methods currently available: volume coupling and surface coupling [5]. The Arlequin method is best suited for coupling different physical models such as continuum particles [7,8] among others. In surfacing coupling, there is no overlapping of different models and different models can be coupled using one of the following methods: (a) Lagrange multiplier method; (b) penalty method; (c) transition element method; and (d) multipoint constraint (MPC) method. The MPC method is an attractive coupling method for coupling mixed-dimensional elements by using constraint equations for nodal displacements at the interface. For instance, the RBE3 MPC method provided in ANSYS code [20] can automatically establish constraint equations for coupling the different types of elements. The elimination scheme enforces the MPC method by eliminating dependent DOFs. Although the deformable MPC method seems more rational and effective, inaccurate constraint equations due to inappropriate stress distribution assumptions may result in stress disturbance at the interface. The proposed coupling method is then extended to nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling problems. To validate the proposed coupling method, a number of finite element test cases are finally examined. 2, is used to illustrate how the constraint equations can achieve both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium at the interface. For any arbitrary interface coupling, the sum of virtual work done by the corresponding forces at the interface of the two types of elements shall be zero. The coefficient matrix                                                                                     C                                                        T                                                of the force constraint equation can be regarded as a distribution matrix to distribute the forces or moment at the node of the beam to the nodes of the plate at the interface. The nodal force model is formed by repeating the substructure with the same mesh and element type, as shown in                          Fig. Then, the iteration process will guarantee the accuracy of the coefficient matrix of the constraint equation without end effects. The rigid connection is a type of MPC which defines a rigid area at the section of plate. The constraint equations are then transformed to a global CS for solution. Therefore, the nonlinear constraint equations for the interface are caused by the material and geometrical nonlinearity and the transformation of coordinates from a local CS to a global CS. The transformation of the coordinate systems is illustrated in Fig. 7 for interface coupling of the L shape member which is modeled as beam elements and shell elements. The relationship between the coefficient matrices of the nonlinear force and displacement constraint equations for the interface is derived in this section. Use the constraint equation in the initial configuration to calculate the response of the system. 15) to calculate the coefficient matrix                                                                                                                         D                                                                                                                           t                                                                                                                                                           of the constraint equation in the current configuration in the global coordinate system. This requires that material nonlinearity does not occur at the coupling interface. These cases include linear beam-to-plate, beam-to-shell and beam-to-solid coupling problems, a linear frame structure for linear structural multi-scale simulation, and a beam-to-shell buckling problem for nonlinear mixed-dimensional FE coupling. The length of the cantilever is 320mm and its cross section is 40mm high and 8mm wide. For the proposed method, the nodal shear forces at the interface are consistent with the nodal shear forces at the internal section. The shear stress contours of the plate model are shown in                          Fig. 12, is used as a numerical example for detailed calculation and discussion of the linear beam-to-shell coupling problem. 13 by using shell element 181 in ANSYS for the middle part of the cantilever and beam element 188 for other parts of the cantilever. For comparison purpose, the cantilever is also entirely modeled by shell elements, which can be taken as one for the exact solution. The stresses of the cantilever are calculated for a concentrated force acting at the left end of the cantilever as shown in Fig. The results from the proposed method are almost the same as the results from the pure shell model. It can be seen that the stress results obtained from the proposed method have no stress disturbance and they are almost the same as the results from the pure shell model. The maximum Von Mises stress from the proposed method, the McCune method and the RBE3 method are 128.966, 132.184 and 236.746N/cm2, respectively. The proposed method, the McCune method and the RBE3 method all are used to calculate the deflections and stresses of the cantilever. For the cantilever of a box cross-section, the deflection results from the proposed method and the McCune method have the same accuracy with a relative error of 0.345%. For the maximum Von Mises stress, the relative errors of the proposed method and the McCune method are 0.000% and 0.580%, respectively. However, the stress results from RBE3 are not accurate with serious stress disturbance. 30 shows a frame structure constructed by one beam and two columns of I cross-section. The frame structure is also modeled with the pure beam element for additional comparison. The Von Mises stress contours of the connection part of the frame structure obtained from different methods are shown in                                                                                                     Figs. 37 displays the loaddisplacement curve at the loading point in the z-direction. The peak loads are 2138.1, 2137.6, 2139.5 and 2139.3N obtained by the proposed method, the distributing coupling method, the pure shell model and the pure beam model, respectively. It can be seen that all the predicted peak loads are similar. However, the loading result from the beam model is slightly larger than that from the pure shell model. A numerical method compatible with commercial FE codes has been developed to figure out the linear and nonlinear constraint equations which satisfy both displacement compatibility and stress equilibrium conditions at the interface.

5,5,S0168874X14001541," Bridging domain method (BDM) is a multiscale method which couples molecular dynamics (MD) with finite element simulations. In this paper, using numerical study we show that time integration step size and the discretization of Lagrange multipliers can highly impact the capability of BDM in removing spurious reflections. We present a technique to enhance the performance of bridging domain method and to alleviate the effects of the two aforementioned factors on the BDM. In our technique, the total displacement field of the atoms located in the overlapping zone is decomposed into a coarse and a fine field. The equations of motion of fine scale oscillations are first obtained and then modified to include a damping term. The damping condition effectively filters out and removes the fine scale oscillations that cannot pass into the continuum domain; hence eliminates the spurious wave reflections. Using numerical examples, we show that the proposed enhancement significantly improves the performance of bridging domain method. This is specially significant when discontinuities such as cracks are present in the domain or when the integration time step is small. ","Molecular dynamics simulations provide vast amount of information about material behavior at nanoscale. Coupled atomistic-continuum methods have been introduced as a remedy to this limitation. This method has been used for modeling cracks and defects in graphene and carbon nanotubes [9,10,29,30] and has been combined with extended finite element method (XFEM) [31] to study crack propagation and dislocation emission in nanomaterials [32,33]. In this method, the total displacement field of atoms located in the overlapping zone is decomposed into a fine and a coarse scale displacement field. The formulation of the new enhancement is presented in Section 4. In this paper, the superscripts A, C, and B identify the variables associated with the atomistic, continuum, and bridging subdomains respectively. The compatibility of deformation between atomistic and continuum domain in the overlapping zone can be imposed in different ways [9,10,36,37]. To find Lagrange multipliers we use predicted displacements from Eqs. ( 3) After finding the Lagrange multipliers, the predicted atomistic and finite element fields will be corrected by considering the Lagrange multiplier forces in Eqs. ( These steps can be repeated until the displacement fields and Lagrange multipliers (                            d                            ,                            u                          and                                                      ) converge. In the bridging domain method the compatibility of displacements between atomistic and continuum domains in the overlapping domain is enforced using Lagrange multipliers, as described in Section 2. This form of approximation imposes a strict displacement compatibility between atomistic and continuum and is the form we will refer to as BDM-strict throughout this paper, (2) Lagrange multipliers are discretized by the same mesh as the FE-mesh i.e. each FE-node in the bridging subdomain coincides a -node. Furthermore, when discontinuities are available in the overlapping zone, the displacement compatibility should be enforced weakly to allow crack surface relaxation [32]. The problem is solved using both diagonalized and consistent constraint matrix employing a small (                                                        t                            =                            0.00025                                                  ps) and a large (                                                        t                            =                            0.002                                                  ps) integration time step. To obtain the reference solution, and for the sake of comparison, the problem is also solved using full MD description for the entire domain. 4a and b show that when consistent constraint matrix is employed, the Hamiltonian of the entire system remains constant and the Hamiltonian of atomistic zone does not go to zero. The wave coarse components have traveled into the continuum domain and the high frequency components are eliminated, as is shown in Fig. To resolve the two above-mentioned issues, we propose an enhanced bridging domain method (EBDM). For this purpose, we obtain the equations of motion of fine scale oscillations and modify it to include a damping term. This idea was later used to develop other multiscale methods such as perfectly matched multiscale method [40]. 2), and                                                                                              C                                                                                                                                                                                     is a user-defined parameter. Using this approximation, very little spurious reflections are developed near                                                                                                                                                                                              C                                                                                    , and the fine scale displacements are effectively eliminated. Also, we solve the problem using both displacement constraint of Eq. ( These plots also confirm that regardless of the size of the overlapping domain, standard BDM methods are more successful in removing spurious reflections when the integration time step is large. The enhancement in the performance is more significant when the overlapping length size is small (n                                                     b                         =1). For this problem, we use =0.467eV and =0.2296nm which leads to an equilibrium bond length of r                         0=0.2577nm of the triangular lattice. The initial geometry and boundary conditions of the domain are shown in Fig. The entire domain dimensions are 63.02nm60.49nm and the initial crack length is 10nm. The number of broken bonds of the pure MD zone versus time is shown in Fig. However, when standard BMD methods are employed to model crack growth, the initial crack does not grow, instead atomic bonds break at the interface of continuum and overlapping zone, leading to the generation of new cracks along                                                                                                                                                                                              A                                                                                    . By increasing the size of overlapping zone, the crack growth path obtained from standard BDM approaches that of pure MD, however this example clearly shows that EBDM is more efficient in modeling problems involving discontinuities. 8 is used to prescribe both tensile and shear components of the external loading. 16a                          and b. These figures clearly show that if the overlapping width L                                                     B                          is small, only EBDM is able to predict the crack path correctly. The key contribution of the paper is proposing a new technique to enhance the performance of bridging domain method in eliminating the spurious wave reflections at the interface of atomistic and continuum domain. The fine scale oscillations correspond to the small wavelength (high frequency) components of the wave and need to be eliminated. Our numerical results showed that the proposed enhancement significantly improves the capability of the bridging domain method in removing the spurious reflections.",0.8051282051282052,0.1440587245756232,0.2443906486592755,0.10619469026548672,0.4311377245508982,0.1704141980119464,0.2,0.6607142857142857,0.30705393834128203
6,6,S0168874X14001619," Laser-assisted machining combines several experimental parameters such as cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, laser power and distance between tool rake face and the laser beam axis. The optimization of these parameters is necessary to ensure the efficiency of assistance and to increase productivity. This paper focuses on the understanding of the physical phenomena during laser-assisted machining, and on optimising this process. This contribution is based on an experimental and a numerical study. The experimentalpart highlights the effects of the laser power as well as the distance between the tool rake face and the axis of the laser beam. As for the numerical part, it was performed on the ABAQUS/Explicit software. The proposed model improves the understanding of the physical phenomena of chip formation and the cutting force reduction when machining with laser assistance. In addition, this model allows a better optimization of laser and cutting parameters.Numerical findings generally corroborate experimental results and can lead to some other information difficult to catch experimentally. The main contention in the paper is that the distance between the axis of the laser beam and the tool rake face is the most important parameter that controls the reduction of the cutting force. This cutting force reduction can exceed 50%. ","Titanium alloys are known for their high mechanical characteristics even at high temperatures and for their corrosion resistance. Besides, some of them are biologically compatible with the human body. The numerical simulation of laser-assisted micro-milling process done by [4] shows that the flow stress drops by 2025% and that there is a reduction in tool wear. This model takes into account laser heating by a uniform initial temperature imposed on the workpiece depending on the laser power used. The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of cutting parameters and those of the laser source on the chip formation and the cutting force. The tungsten carbide tool is considered deformable, flank angle =7, rake angle =7 and nose radius                                                                                              r                                                                                                                                                                                       =                            30                                                                                    m                         . This model is meshed by 4-node quadrangle elements (CPE4RT) of about 12m in the cutting area (according to [9]). 1) corresponds to the hardening, A is the yield stress, B and n are the hardening parameters. Delalondre [15] explains the occurrence of adiabatic shear bands (ASB) by three phases:                                                           1. For the ASB that is formed, the temperature reaches its maximum and the stress reaches its minimum. Temperature fields (a) and (c) have the same power level but with different speeds respectively 0.66m/s and 1.3m/s. In fact, the increase in displacement speed decreases the laser-material interaction time. In fact, the purely thermal simulation described previously, allows us to know the optimal distance between the tool and the laser beam. However, for the cutting depths up to 0.2mm a slight reduction is expected when using a laser power of 500W. This reduction will not be significant because the temperature levels are not enough to soften the material. The contact between the tool and the workpiece is handled by a masterslave algorithm. 7                          shows the temperature fields in different conditions at a point of the tool rake face. It is, therefore, possible to have an effect of the laser assistance on the chip formation without an excessive thermal loading of the tool. 8                          demonstrates that the heat flux (                            W                            /                                                                                             mm                                                                                                2                                                                                    ) induced by plastic deformation in LAM conditions is less than the heat flux generated in CM condition. The laser source used is Nd: YAG laser with a maximum power of 2.5kW. The acquisition of the components of the cutting forces is obtained using a Kistler dynamometer (9257B): F                                                     t                          is the cutting force (tangential force) and F                                                     r                          is the radial force. Moreover, this effort reduction is even greater when the laser power is increased. In most circumstances, the adjustment of the distance to about 5mm is more effective in reducing the cutting force. Increasing the laser power leads to a better rate of reduction of the cutting force. These changes in the shear angle  and the distance Dc generate an increased frequency of segmentation of the chip. CONCLUSION   A new cutting model was developed to understand the mechanics of chip formation in the case of laser-assisted machining. The LAM model and the experimental study had highlighted the change in the geometry of the chip. The shear angle and the chip thickness decrease with the increase of the laser power.",0.6496296296296297,0.2112235067437379,0.3187941290891786,0.06153846153846154,0.16374269005847952,0.0894568650386859,0.17100371747211895,0.4380952380952381,0.24598930077425726
7,7,S0168874X14001620," Although optimization methods are useful in the preliminary design of cable-stayed bridges for sizing of components and getting optimal bridge configurations, further fine-tuning is invariably conducted in the detailed design thus affecting various sensitive properties such as the deck profile and cable forces. The zero-displacement method that adjusts the initial cable lengths repeatedly to achieve the design deck profile is both computationally intensive and prone to convergence difficulty. Therefore a calibration method is proposed based on a Kriging surrogate model built using the uniform design approach. Apart from establishing the relationship between the bridge deck geometry and the initial cable forces by statistical method, the Kriging model also obviates the need for a large number of repeated finite element analyses. A simple cable-stayed bridge is used to verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. In real-life cable-stayed bridges with many cables, a staged calibration is implemented so that the Kriging model is used to identify reasonable initial forces in the critical stay cables so that the zero-displacement method or similar can be used for further adjustments. Verification shows that this staged calibration can address not only the deck level tolerance but also the control of cable forces. ","Cable-stayed bridges have become more and more popular over the past 50 years because of their desirable structural and aesthetic characteristics. A cable-stayed bridge typically comprises the deck, the towers and the cables. In view of this, the development of a finite element model by suitably adjusting the initial cable forces is an important milestone to provide a reference for more accurate analyses afterwards. For example, steel plates are manufactured to have certain standard thicknesses, stay cables consist of a number of strands of standard sizes, reinforcing bars have certain standard sizes, and the variations of deck section is often in steps rather than being continuous. In view of the complexity of real-life cable-stayed bridges, cable force calibration is often achieved by iteration using various commercial finite element packages with programming facilities [11] that allow optimization to be carried out under various constraints considered appropriate. The surrogate model, which can be constructed after determining the relationship between the variables and the responses using design points [13], has the advantages of high efficiency, easy implementation and adequate accuracy. Many alternative surrogate models are available, including the response surface method, Gaussian process meta-model, Kriging model, etc. To address the drawbacks of various available methods for deck profile calibration, an efficient Kriging surrogate model is proposed to calibrate the initial cable forces. The complicated relationship between the geometry of the bridge deck and the initial cable forces of a cable-stayed bridge can be obtained by establishing a Kriging model using statistical methodology. The construction of the Kriging model for calibration of initial cable forces consists of several steps as elaborated below. The system deviation z                                                     l                         (x) is assumed to have zero mean and variance                                                                                                                                                                                              l                                                                                                2                                                                                    . The Kriging model is created with the initial cable forces and the displacements at control points of the deck associated with the sampling points of the model. A suitable optimization function is formulated to minimize the residuals of displacements of the deck at the control points between the field measurements and estimates from the Kriging model. In view of the relatively short lengths, the sag effect of the cables is ignored. The deck is modelled by 84 beam elements while the towers are modelled by 8 beam elements. From finite element analysis, the corresponding vertical displacements at the control points from Nodes 28 under permanent loading can be obtained respectively as [0.034436 0.0094001 0.0091918 0.13097 0.22358 0.29343 0.33057]m where upward displacement is taken as positive. As long as the estimated initial cable forces are reasonable, the sensitivity results are not affected much. The corresponding initial cable forces obtained together with the discrepancies with the objective values are shown in                          Table 4 for subsequent comparison. Table 6 shows that Columns 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 11 of Table 5 should be used to form the design for the 6 factors. As the 16 levels are evenly distributed in the range of [5,17]103                         kN, Levels 1, 2 and 16, for example, correspond to cable forces of 5.75103                         kN, 6.5103                         kN and 17103                         kN respectively. Assuming the same starting values of initial cable forces of [8 8 8 8 8 8]103                         kN as before, iteration by sequential quadratic programming can be carried out using the Kriging model to calibrate the cable forces efficiently. The calculated displacements at the control points are shown in                          Table 9, while the corresponding initial cable forces are given in                          Table 10. The adoption of slip-forming helps to control the accuracy of the cross sectional dimensions and hence the uncertainties of the cross sectional area and moment of inertia may be less significant. Hence there are totally 2560 calibration runs as described in Section 4.3. Two levels of uncertainty of deck level measurement, namely 1% and 5% COV, are assumed for all deck nodes without rigid support. 7 shows the significance of uncertainties in deck level measurements. Measurements at Nodes 7 and 8 are the most significant for the exterior cables, i.e. Cables 1 and 2. 9 from A to D and E to I for those at the Ting Kau End and Tsing Yi End respectively. The finite element model of Ting Kau Bridge is constructed using the commercial package ANSYS Multiphysics 12.0. The flexibility method is used first to obtain the initial values of the cable forces [37]. To comply with the allowable tolerance of 5mm, the cable forces can be further adjusted manually but this will be extremely time-consuming. Considering the actual construction process on site and the practicality of deck profile calibration, the cable forces in each group of end back-stay cables for a longitudinal girder are assumed to be the same. The control displacements include the 40 vertical displacements at the deck anchorages of the end back-stay cables (Fig. The Kriging model can be built efficiently using the uniform design approach with a prescribed number of finite element analyses. With the set of reasonable initial cable forces, further calibration can be carried out by iteration to satisfy not only the deck level tolerance but also the allowable cable stresses.

8,8,S0168874X14001577," In this paper, the concept of configurational forces is introduced in the context of finite element mesh refinement for elasticideally plastic problems. This paper also includes the numerical computation of configurational forces in the elastic and plastic domains. Methods are demonstrated on three plane problems where the analytical solution is available. The first example is a thick-walled tube loaded by internal pressure. This simple, one dimensional problem allows computation of configurational volume forces analytically to validate the finite element (FE) results. The second example is Galins problem that involves an infinite plate with a circular hole loaded by biaxial tension at the infinity. This is a two dimensional problem for which the analytical solution is known with some restrictions for elasticideally plastic case when Tresca yield criterion is considered. The last example introduces another plane problem that follows Naghdis solution on infinite wedges. For this, a new analytical solution is presented for plane stress state using von Mises yield criterion with a uniform shear loading along the boundary. R-, h-, and combined adaptive procedures are demonstrated on the above examples. Since exact stress fields are known, the norm of the difference between numerical and analytical solutions is used as the measure of error. ","Configurational mechanics, presented by Eshelby in the early fifties, is widely used in several areas of theoretical continuum mechanics and computational mechanics (see [8,10]). Brauns method is based on the property that the configurational force [10] must be zero in the interior of the homogeneous material [13]. The material equilibrium equation that must be fulfilled to reach optimal mesh configuration is different from the elastic case. The plastic part of configurational forces becomes zero in the purely elastic domain. For validation of the finite element results a few examples, which have analytical solution, are also presented. In this contribution, a novel solution is proposed that is new to the best of our knowledge. In this section, the governing equations of the configurational force are recapitulated for linear elastic and elasticperfectly plastic material models at small deformation. If the physical body force,                          f                       is zero, and a homogeneous body is considered, the vector                          g                       becomes zero [24]. In this section, the concept of the configurational force driven mesh refinement is presented. Based on the expressions shown in Section 2, the numerical computation is straightforward. The nodal values of the plastic strain are projected from the integration points by the interpolation functions                                                                                     N                                                                                       j                                                                              (                                                  ,                                                  )                      . In the case of h-adaptive method, the local mesh refinement is also driven by the norm of nodal configurational forces. When the value of this norm exceeds a required limit, than it is necessary to refine the mesh around the nodes in question. The second one is Galins solution on an infinite rectangular plate with a circular hole subjected to biaxial tension under plane strain condition [5]. Elasticideally plastic material, plane strain and the Tresca yield criterion is considered when k=150MPa. The difference between the two quantities indicates the error of the mesh. The solution of this problem is originated from the work of Galin [5]. Due to the symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modelled. The dimensions are a=10mm and                             r                            =                            0.2                                                        mm                         . In the finite element analysis, linear, four noded quadrilateral elements are used. This quantity shows the difference between the analytically and numerically evaluated stress tensors directly. The second strategy examined here is the h-adaptive method given by Eq. ( It is important to mention that the transition between mesh segments with different densities could contain highly distorted elements locally decreasing the accuracy. Plane stress condition and von Mises yield criterion are assumed. In the following section, only a small square is considered with an area of                             a                                                        a                            =                            1                                                                                                                         mm                                                                                                2                                                                                    . It can be seen that maximal error configurational forces arise on the elasticplastic boundaries and in the vicinity of the corner. 12                         ) that is more suitable for the given problem. The so-called r-adaptive scheme, first proposed by Braun [2], is also applicable for elasticplastic analysis. However, application of this method requires more computation time since the optimal nodal configuration can only be achieved through iteration and it is necessary to solve the original problem in each step. The stresses in the elastic zone are computed according to [1].",0.6740250183958794,0.2121352477999073,0.3227066179787581,0.0782608695652174,0.19889502762430938,0.11232448892696441,0.22556390977443608,0.48,0.30690536649420136
9,9,S0168874X14001607," The higher-order gradient plasticity theory is successful in explaining the size effects encountered at the micron and submicron length scale. Due to the incorporation of spatial gradients of one or more internal variables in these theories and the associated non-classical boundary conditions, special types of elements in the finite element method maybe necessary. This makes the numerical implementation of this higher-order theory not straightforward. In this paper, a robust but straightforward numerical implementation of higher-order gradient-dependent plasticity theories is presented. The novelty of this paper is in (1) the application of the meshless methods, particularly the moving weighted least square method, combined with the finite element method for the numerical computation of plastic strain gradients, and (2) the numerical implementation of different types of higher-order microscopic boundary conditions at internal/external surfaces, interfaces, and moving elasticplastic boundaries. The proposed numerical implementation algorithms can be easily adapted in the implementation of any form of higher-order gradient-dependent constitutive models. Examples of applying the current numerical approach is demonstrated for capturing mesh-objective shear band formation and size effect and boundary layer formation in thin films on elastic substrates and metal matrix composites with embedded elastic inclusions through the consideration of stiff, intermediate, and soft interfaces. ","There are numerous experimental results that indicate a size-dependent mechanical behavior of materials at the micron and submicron length scales, in the sense that smaller is stronger. For this type of implementation, which can be identified as a mixed-type formulation, one should formulate new elements when using the finite element method, which results in solving a very large size of linear algebraic system of equations. The lack of robust C1-continuous elements motivated the development of various penalty-enhanced C0-continuous class functions, discontinuous and continuous/discontinuous Galerkin methods for the interpolation of the plastic/damage multipliers or other field variables such as stress and strain in the finite element context [4750]. The application of MMs is exploited to analyze the gradient plasticity theories [53,54]. However, one of the major difficulties in the numerical implementation using MMs is the non-interpolatory character of the approximation. In Section 4, in order to verify the numerical implementation, the results from an exact solution for the application of higher-order gradient plasticity to shear band formation and size effects in metallic thin films on elastic substrates is compared to the numerical solution. However, it should be emphasized that the current numerical implementation technique is general and can be used for formulating and implementing more complex higher-order strain gradient plasticity models. For the time interval from the previous time t to the current time                             t                            +                                                        t                         , the backward Euler method enables the proposed constitutive model to be discretized. Appropriate and consistent higher-order boundary conditions should accompany the solution of Eq. ( These conditions imply that the moving elasticplastic boundary can act as either an instantaneous micro-rigid boundary where dislocations are not allowed to flow or as an instantaneous micro-free boundary where there is no resistance for dislocation flow through the boundary. Also, it can be argued that such boundary conditions could be avoided in case of rate-dependent plasticity (viscoplasticity) since a moving elasticplastic boundary does not exist. The application of MWLSM for solving the gradient-dependent plasticity model has been shown thoroughly by Pamin et al. [ Here, we will apply the MWLSM following the approach presented by Abu Al-Rub and Voyiadjis [45] in the sense that the plastic multipliers are considered as independent variables in the local (inner-level) computations while the displacement is obtained from the global (outer-level) computations. In fact, this can be achieved through using the MWLSM, which is the main subject of this paper for implementing the current higher-order gradient plasticity model and its corresponding higher-order boundary conditions. The main feature of the MWLSM is a kernel function (weight function) that is used in defining the interpolation functions,                                                                                                                                                                                              n                                                                                    , for each nodal point. Here, the weight function has a compact support in the sense that the sub-domain                                                                                                                                                                                              m                                                                                     for node m is nonzero and small relative to the rest of the domain. 2 shows a typical overlapping circle-shape sub-domain with an exponential weight function with a radius of influence                                                                                              R                                                                                                d                                  o                                  m                                                                                    . These two values do not generally fit, and after finding                                                                                                                                                                                               one should obtain the approximated solution from Eq. ( The weight function is a monotonically decreasing function, i.e. the more distanced a neighbor to the point of interest the lower contribution in the minimization equation. This is why MWLSM is suitable for gradient-enhanced plasticity models as it easily satisfies the requirement of higher-order continuity that the FEM enforces when implementing gradient-dependent plasticity models. As mentioned in Section 1, unlike the FEMs interpolation function, continuity is controlled by the continuity of weight function only and this can be another reason for selecting the exponential type of the weight function expressed in Eq. ( 36) in order to accurately capture the plastic strain distribution and the corresponding Laplacian. 3(c), where for                                                               =                               0                             the LSM is recovered. Therefore, choosing a proper domain for approximating the Laplacian term, which is controlled by the weight function, is critical and special care should be taken in selecting the value of                                                            . Also, increasing the size of domain of influence increases the computational cost. In this section, the procedure needed to calculate the nonlocal incremental plastic Lagrange multipliers through using Eqs. ( The size of                                                       in Eq. ( The values of                                                                                   that are obtained from enforcing the higher-order boundary conditions at the interfacial nodal points are substituted in Eq. ( This example will demonstrate the performance of the proposed implementation method in obtaining mesh-objective results when simulating a plane strain two-dimensional specimen with geometric imperfection under uniaxial tension (                            Fig. The strip is constrained at the bottom and its upper edge is constrained to remain horizontal while a vertical displacement is applied. The results for two different triangular meshes (400 and 800 elements) are presented for both classical plasticity and the gradient plasticity. This figure shows that the gradient plasticity gives mesh objective results. 9(a) and (b) that the first-order gradient of effective plastic strain in both x and y directions has a zero value at the center of the localized zone and the elastic-plastic boundary. Also, the role of different higher-order boundary conditions on the strengthening and strain hardening of small scale systems is demonstrated. 10(b) shows schematically the formation of the boundary layer due to the dislocation pile-up at the film-substrate interface. The analytical solution for this example using the current strain gradient plasticity model is presented in the Appendix A.                                                          Fig. The numerical solution matches the analytical solution indicating the accuracy of the implementation. Furthermore, for a specific                                                               /                               t                             ratio, the stress-strain response follows the stiff interface behavior (i.e. with the same hardening tangent modulus) after interface yielding such that the hardening modulus is the same as the hardening modulus of the bulk since interfacial hardening is not considered for this case. Also, for the case of a stiff interface and for a constant                                                               /                               t                             ratio, one can notice that the plastic strain is zero at the interface (Fig. 15, for the case of intermediate interfaces, the interface yield strength controls the overall macroscopic yield strength of the film-substrate system, while the interface hardening controls its overall rate of hardening. 16(b) for                                                                                                                                                                                                                1                                                                                                =                               5                            . The enhanced strength and strain hardening of metals that contain micron and submicron sized inclusions is attributed to the indirect strengthening due to evolution of GNDs at the particle-matrix interface as well as the conventional direct strengthening from the load transfer from the matrix to the particle e.g. [1,74,75]. 18(a) and (c), the effective von Mises stress distribution is significantly higher once plastic strain gradients are considered; notably more localized in the matrix material around the inclusion where the magnitude of effective plastic strain gradient (or equivalently the density of GNDs) is significantly higher. A comparison between these contours reveals that, unlike the classical plasticity models prediction (Fig. 19(a) shows the contours of nonlocal effective plastic strain presented in Eq. ( 18(d) and 19(a) one can see that the plastic strain gradient has a substantial effect on the total density of dislocations. As expected, the maximum value of GNDs occurs around the inclusion where dislocation blocking has been occurred. 13), for the simulated soft and intermediate interfaces, respectively. This is followed by a local (inner-level) computation where the nonlocal plastic consistency condition subjected to the microscopic (non-classical) boundary conditions is solved by considering the effective plastic strain as a degree of freedom. The successful application of the formulated higher-order gradient plasticity model and its numerical implementation to capture size effect has been shown for examples including shear deformation of a thin film on an elastic substrate and uniaxial loading of a unit cell with elastic circular inclusions. In the absence of the interfacial energy, uniform plastic strain similar to classical plasticity has been observed. While the plastic strain has the zero value at interface due to dislocation blocking for hard interface in gradient enhanced model, this magnitude is high for the classical model and more confined within a small region near the inclusion.

10,10,S0168874X14001565," An Element-free Galerkin scaled boundary method (EFG-SBM) based partitioning algorithm is proposed for the 2D steady-state heat transfer analysis of cyclically symmetrical structures. The eigenvalue matrices of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system are proved to be block-circulant under a symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations can be partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm in term of computing accuracy and efficiency. ","As a semi-analytical method [14], the scaled boundary method (SBM) is more efficient than finite element method (FEM) for problems involving unbounded domain or/and local singularity [57], and has been combined with FEM [36], meshless local petrov-galerkin method (MLPGM) [7], or element-free galerkin method (EFGM) [8,9] to tackle with elastostatics or heat transfer problems. h and T                                               a                       refer to the convection heat transfer coefficient and environmental temperature.

The relative error of solutions given by the proposed algorithm and ANSYS is less than 0.80%. Both geometry and physical properties are cyclic symmetry with N=8, but essential boundary condition is not cyclic symmetry.

11,11,S0168874X14001590," This paper deals with the assessment of a refined sinus model for multilayered composite plates in the framework of severe test cases to highlight the interest and limitations of such an approach. The present sinus model is enriched by higher-order terms for both in-plane and transverse displacements, and layer refinement. This kinematics allows us to exactly ensure both (i) the continuity conditions for displacements and transverse shear stresses at the interfaces between layers of a laminated structure, and (ii) the traction-free conditions at the upper and lower surfaces of the plates. The number of unknowns is independent of the number of layers. A C1 6-node triangular finite element implementation is proposed, which does not suffer any numerical pathologies. First, the present approach is assessed on its capability to capture the steep transverse stress gradients occurring in the vicinity of free edges and is also compared with models available in the literature. Then, a highly anisotropic sandwich structure proposed by Meyer-Piening is also addressed for further comparison. ","Composite and sandwich structures are widely used in the weight-sensitive industrial applications due to their excellent mechanical properties, especially their high specific stiffness and strength. In this context, they can be subjected to severe mechanical loading. The first one leads to inaccurate results for composites because both transverse and normal strains are neglected. This permits us to reduce the number of unknowns and can be viewed as a Zig-Zag model. As an alternative, the layer-wise kinematics proposed by Reddy [5], in which the displacement components are interpolated along z through Lagrange polynomials, was successfully applied by Robbins and Reddy to the PipesPagano problem [22]. It is one of the only approach which has been assessed on a wide range of test cases [3133], in particular concerning the local stress concentration occurring in both free edge and localized pressure for highly anisotropic sandwich. This is essential for thick structures and multifield problems. Note that the FE presented in [36] was dedicated to cross ply and symmetric angle ply schemes. U                             is the space of admissible virtual displacements. It is based on                                                                                          various works on beams, plates and shells, [37,39] covering the refined theory, and  the so-called 1,2-3 double-superposition theory of Li and Liu [40] developed in the sinus approach for plate in Vidal and Polit [35]. Moreover, this refined model (see Vidal and Polit [41]) takes into account the continuity conditions between layers of the laminate for both displacements and transverse shear stresses, and the traction-free conditions on the upper and lower surfaces. The choice of the sinus function can be justified from the three-dimensional point of view, using the work of Cheng [43]. 15) is a good starting point for finite element approximations of the displacement. The elementary stiffness matrix                             [                                                                                             K                                                                                                e                                                                                       ]                          is deduced from Eq. ( The superscript h indicates the finite element approximation. Since the Argyris interpolation is a polynomial of the fifth order and the Ganev interpolation of the fourth order, we can immediately conclude that the transverse shear locking is avoided as the field compatibility is automatically ensured for the transverse shear strains, see for example [45]. Due to the very long expressions for these interpolations, the reader is referred to either the original papers of Argyris et al [46] and Ganev and Dimitrov [47], or to a more recent book of Bernadou [48]. For more details, the reader can refer to the work of Polit and Touratier [36]. Note that these boundary conditions can be managed automatically using a reference number. The reader can refer to [35,36] for more details about the excellent properties of this FE concerning accuracy and convergence rate. The comparisons will involve different refined kinematics models with the same FE approximation based on ArgyrisGanev interpolations [38,45,50]:                                                     SinRef16p                            present model with 16 unknown functions. Convergence studies performed with 3D Ansys elements, not presented for the sake of conciseness, have shown that                             a                            =                            2                            b                            =                            8                            h                          provides a sufficient plate length. The results issued from the SinRef16p model are in very good agreement with the 3D results. On the contrary, the SinRef16p model, which includes two and one additional terms for the in-plane and transverse displacements respectively, has capability to represent the strong variation of the stresses. For all these results, the refined Sinus model performs better as these two models. The variation of the transverse normal and shear stresses at the bi-material interfaces is shown in Fig. The SinRef16p is closer to the reference solution than the ED4 model. The same comment can be made for the variation of the transverse shear stress along the x                         2-axis at the bi-material interface, see Fig. The second study deals with a benchmark problem proposed by Meyer-Piening [14]. It involves a simply -supported rectangular sandwich plate submitted to a localized pressure applied on an area of 520mm. For this reason, this test case can be used to well discriminate different 2D theories. In the following, the LM4 results are considered as the reference ones. The results are summarized in Table 4                          for both displacements and stresses. The zig-zag behavior of the in-plane displacement is well captured whereas the ED4 and EDZ4 results are far from the reference solution (note the different scale of the ordinates). The field compatibility for transverse shear strains is assured. 15, the present approach is able to capture the overall response, but accurate values can be only obtained by high order LW models as LM4. The results show that it is needed to have at least a fourth-order expansion of the in-plane displacements and a cubic one for the transverse deflection to capture the steep mechanical quantities gradient in the vicinity of the free edge or loads.",0.7987249544626593,0.1542656112576957,0.2585886184502182,0.06340057636887608,0.2802547770700637,0.1034077525726146,0.1518324607329843,0.5272727272727272,0.23577235425176815
12,12,S0168874X14001553," A modified interval parameter perturbation finite element method (MIPPM) and a reliability-based optimization model are proposed for the coupled structural-acoustic field prediction and structural design with uncertainties in both the physical parameters and boundary conditions. Interval variables are used to quantitatively describe all the uncertain parameters with limited information. The interval matrix and vector are expanded by the modified Taylor series. Compared with the traditional perturbation method, the proposed MIPPM can yield more accurate ranges of the uncertain structural-acoustic field, in which the higher order terms of Neumann series are employed to approximate the interval matrix inverse. The reliability idea is introduced to establish an interval optimization model relying on the satisfaction degree of interval. The uncertain constraints can be transformed into deterministic ones if given the confidence level. The proposed MIPPM is used to predict the intervals of the constraints, and whereby eliminate the optimization nesting. Numerical results about a 3D car are given to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm. ","In recent years, with the increase of peoples awareness of environment and requirement for comfort, research on acoustic behavior inside the cabin is becoming a challenging problem for the lager complex structures such as cars, boats and airplanes. Marburg [8] described the noise transfer function including structural harmonic analysis, acoustic influence coefficients and their coupling, and proposed the well-known semianalytic calculation of harmonic displacement sensitivities. On this basis, Xia and Yu developed the interval and subinterval perturbation methods to predict the acoustic field with uncertain-but-bounded parameters [22,23]. Hence, establishing effective numerical methods and optimization models for the structural-acoustic system with interval parameters has great significance both in theory and engineering. In Section 4, the new model and algorithm of interval reliability optimization are proposed based on the satisfaction degree of interval. For a structural-acoustic system with the flexible boundary structure as shown in                       Fig. 7) become interval matrices and vector with respect to the interval parameter vector                                                I                      . By substituting above two denotations (16) and (18) into Eq. ( For two interval numbers a                                               I                       and b                                               I                      , there are six positional cases as shown in                       Fig. Under the assumption that the physical properties and external load are deterministic, the first-order characteristic frequency locates at 78Hz. Thus, we choose 6888Hz as the target frequency range in the numerical example. For the eleven selected frequencies, the lower bound (LB) and upper bound (UB) of the sound pressure amplitude at the observation point calculated by Monte Carlo method (abbreviated as MCM), FIPPM and MIPPM are listed in                       Table 2. From the comparison between the relative errors, it can be observed that the accuracy of MIPPM in which the higher order terms are retained is much higher than the accuracy of FIPPM where only the first-order perturbation terms are considered. ,                                                                                                      T                                                                                                         4                                                                                                )                                                        T                                               . In the traditional optimization, it allows for uncertainty in the design process. The mean structural mass receives significantly reduction from 283.18kg to 240.28kg as shown in Fig. Thus, the MIPPM can obtain more accurate response bounds and greatly reduce the huge computational cost of Monte Carlo simulation. Given full consideration to uncertain parameters in the model-establishing phase, the proposed reliability-based optimization technology can capture better design results compared with traditional deterministic optimization.

13,13,S0168874X14001589," This paper deals with modeling and model reduction methods intended to sandwich structures with viscoelastic materials. The modeling step is carried out by combining the First order shear deformation theory (FSDT) with the GollaHughesMc Tavish (GHM) model. The GHM model introduces auxiliary coordinates to take into account the frequency dependence of viscoelastic materials which, combined with the finite element method (FEM), leads to large order models. This paper focuses on the use of model reduction methods. The reduced models compared to the full model are illustrated by three numerical examples in order to outline the performance, the practical interest of these methods and their validity domains. ","The use of viscoelastic [1,2] sandwich structures [3] has been regarded as a convenient strategy for many industries such as aeronautics, marines and automotives. Thus, the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) introduced by Reissner and Mindlin [4,7] takes into account this effect and assumes a linear variation of the midplane displacements through the thickness of the structure. Nevertheless, when the study is intended for thin structures, the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) presents a suitable choice for the modeling of sandwich structures favored by its simple implementation in most finite element codes. Furthermore, the GHM model, combined with the finite element method (FEM) [15], allows the introduction of viscoelastic material properties through element mass, stiffness, and damping matrices. The present paper proposes an alternative of model reduction such as dynamic [16,17], Guyan [18,19], modal and modal in physical space (SEREP) [2023] reduction methods for this problem. This method restitutes also the first modes of the undamped structure and partitions the modal basis into master and slave dofs. 28] and De Lima and Rade [29] used the modal reduction in their studies frequently. In fact, there are attempts to replace components with classical materials (steel, concrete) by laminated materials, notably sandwich structures. There is no slip or delamination between the layers, they are perfectly bonded. The sandwich is a homogeneous material on a macro-scale level, but its properties depend in turn on the properties of each layer. Herein,                                                                                     N                                                                                       c                                                                            is considered equal to 3. Hence, the GHM model can be developed for direct incorporation into the finite element method. The inclusion of the frequency-dependent behavior of the viscoelastic material can be made by generating                          [                                                                                    K                                                                                       V                                                                              (                         s                         )                         ]                       for specific types of elements (beams, plates, etc.) Indeed, the elimination dofs approach is based on the partition of the full dofs of the structure into m master and s slave dofs. In fact, based on the type of coordinates retained as the reduced order coordinates, the existing model order reduction methods fall into three basic categories:                                                                                 Physical coordinates reduction. In the physical coordinates model method, the reduced model is obtained by removing part of the physical coordinates of the full model. It is based on the modal projection in the physical coordinates. Consequently, the reduced mass, stiffness and damping matrices can then be written in the form of Eq. ( The modal reduction in physical space method allows the derivation of a reduced model which is a subset of the original model expressed in physical coordinates. Furthermore, this technique provides an expanded choice of master dofs but it remains limited by the minimum conditioning condition. The values of the parameters of the viscoelastic commercially available 242F01, manufactured by 3M used at 25C for one mini-oscillator, are presented in                       Table 2                       [29]. In the remainder of this section, the results derived from the implementation of the GHM model, as well as the responses of reduced models used the reduction techniques described as above will be presented both in frequency and in time domains. 8), which describes the shear modulus as a rational function as well as by Eq. ( Table 3 represents the five first undamped and damped frequencies of the viscoelastic sandwich beam. For the Guyan reduction method, the choice of m=30 master dofs is constituted by the                                                                                                                u                                                                                                                  z                                                                                                       dofs which are the translation dofs normal to the midplane of the sandwich beam. This leads to the conclusion that the Guyan reduction method has the capacity to reproduce the original system but it remains limited by its validity domain. Indeed, we determine first the number of modes associated with the undamped structure, which covers 1.5 the frequency band of interest (1.5f                                                                 u                               =1100Hz) and (p=17 modes). Hence, the two transformation matrices must have the same size to compare them such that the master dofs of the Guyan reduction method is equal to the master dofs of modal reduction in the physical space method. 9(a) and (b) represents the corresponding frequency responses comparison. Consequently, through the projection on physical coordinates both Guyan and modal reduction in physical space are viable methods which can reproduce the original model. Hence, as can be remarked, while the reduction ratio in terms of models dimension is about 50%, it is so advantageous in terms of CPU time. The additional CPU time for the modal reduction method in generalized or physical space can be explained by the calculation requirements of undamped modes and the verification of minimum conditioning number in the case of projection on physical space. The interest here is intended to time domain analysis for the viscoelastic sandwich structures. Here both steady state and transient analysis are carried out. This technique is used in order to derive the time responses for both full and reduced models which will be compared for each reduction method. Gerges [40] proved that a relative error of order of                                                                     4                                  %                                in energy E,                                                                     2                                  %                                in central time T and                                                                     4                                  %                                in root mean square D are admissible in order to validate the reduced model compared to the full model. The steady state response is established after 1s of transient response and the oscillations are well stable over a period of time from 2 to 3s. 10(a) shows that the time responses curves for the full model and those of reduced models are in good correlation over a period of time of 1s. As can be seen, in this case, the results start to lose their accuracy. Hence, beyond the cutoff frequency, the Guyan reduction method is less accurate. This is confirmed by the values of the three central temporal moments. The comparison of the Guyan reduction method with the modal reduction method in physical space for steady state responses is also carried out. Furthermore, as mentioned in the previous sections, for each reduction approach the equality of reduction basis is provided. The derived transient results for both reduced and full models are presented in                                Fig. Table 10 presents the performance of the proposed reduced models compared to the full model in time domain. Hence, the distribution of the chosen master dofs (m=40) is illustrated in Fig. The excitation and the responses are depicted in point E as presented in Fig. For the elimination dofs reduction approach, Guyan and dynamic basis are constructed such that the two bases have the same size (83104195). As can be seen, the frequency response derived from the Guyan reduction method has the capacity here to reproduce the frequency response of the full model for the first four modes. This implies that the Guyan reduction method is a viable method for the prediction of the dynamic behavior of viscoelastic sandwich structures, when the choice of master dofs is optimal. 16 shows the frequency responses for the reduced models derived from modal and modal reduction in physical space methods compared to the full model. Indeed, the viscoelastic sandwich plate is subjected to a harmonic load of amplitude equal to 1N under an excitation frequency equal to 400Hz (around the second mode of vibration for the sandwich plate). This is clarified by the values of the three central moments (E, T, D) (                               Table 12.1), which is identical to those of the full model. For the Guyan reduction method, the steady state response reproduces the original response with a relative error in energy E which does not exceed 0.007% as shown in                                Table 12.2 while the central moments T and D, indicators of error in periodicity, are identical to those of the full model. This leads to the conclusion that modal and modal reduction in physical space are viable methods for predicting the dynamic behavior of viscoelastic sandwich plate. Hence, these reduction methods constitute an efficient solution to gain time and to handle large finite elements models with viscoelastic components. Furthermore, the cutoff frequency of the viscoelastic substructure (SS2) is equal to 165Hz. After that, the reduced matrices are assembled taking into account the localized nonlinearities in the junctions between the two viscoelastic substructures (SS1) and (SS2) leading to a global reduced system of order 1610. This shift is about 3% in energy E, 0.1% in T and 0.2% in D for the displacement responses and 5% in E, 0.3% in T and 0.1% in D for the velocity responses. Hence, this reduction method presents an efficient tool to handle non-linear structures with viscoelastic materials in time domain, which enables one to perform the frequency analysis with more specific techniques such as the harmonic balance method. The performance of the proposed method in terms of CPU time is shown in                             Table 15. Consequently, model reduction methods have been proposed as a convenient alternative for this problem. As a result, the reduced model reproduces well the original model with good accuracy and less CPU time, making it the best choice of model reduction methods for the compromise accuracy-time gain in the direct reduction procedure. Next, the Guyan reduction method is expressed by a static basis, neglecting the inertia associated with the slave coordinates.",0.9551192145862551,0.0623626373626373,0.1170817071383247,0.03193430656934307,0.3465346534653465,0.05847953061858215,0.0975609756097561,0.6666666666666666,0.17021276373019467
14,14,S0168874X14001875," Three models were developed to simulate the transfer of prestress force from steel to concrete in pre-tensioned concrete elements. The first is an analytical model based on the thick-walled cylinder theory and considers linear material properties for both steel and concrete. The second is an axi-symmetric finite element (FE) model with linear material properties; it is used to verify the analytical model. The third model is a three dimensional nonlinear FE model. This model considers the post-cracking behaviour of concrete as well as concrete shrinkage and the time of prestress releasing. A new expression from the analytical model is developed to estimate the transmission length as well as the stress distribution along the tendon. The paper also presents a parametric study to illustrate the impact of diameter of prestressing steel, concrete cover, concrete strength, initial prestress, section size, surface roughness of prestressing steel, time of prestress release, and the member length on the transfer of stress in pre-tensioned concrete elements. cross sectional area of concrete cross sectional area of prestressing steel internal radius of cylinder external radius of cylinder the nominal diameter of the prestressing length of small element in longitudinal direction Youngs modulus concrete Youngs modulus prestressing steel Youngs modulus eccentricity, which defines the rate at which the function approaches the asymptote average longitudinal stress in concrete at x concrete compressive strength after 28 days in MPa longitudinal stress in prestressing steel at x bond stress at x effective prestress (beyond transmission zone) initial prestress tensile strength DruckerPrager hyperbolic function of flow potential fracture energy ratio of the second invariant on the tensile meridian to that on compressive meridian transmission length number of mesh segments around the tendon radial pressure applied internal pressure in the radial direction applied external pressure in the radial direction hydrostatic pressure von Mises equivalent stress deformed nominal radius of the prestressing strands or bars nominal radius of prestressing steel bar internal radius of concrete cylinder which equals radius of steel bar after prestressing external radius of concrete cylinder age in days degree of temperature radial deformation at a radius equal r radial deformation of pre-stressing bar at the outer perimeter radial deformation of concrete cylinder at the inner perimeter position along the transmission length coefficient of thermal expansion change in temperature shrinkage strain Poissons ratio Poissons ratio of concrete Poissons ratio of steel initial equibiaxial compressive yield stress uni-axial compressive yield stress maximum principal effective stress uni-axial tensile stress at failure applied stress in the longitudinal direction tangential stress coefficient of friction angle of dilation ","The prestress force in pre-tensioned concrete elements is transferred from the steel to the concrete over a certain length, which is known as the transmission length. The formulae of the transmission length in the current design code are basically developed empirically for normal types of concrete. The transmission length is influenced by many factors such as diameter of prestressing steel, initial or effective prestress, concrete strength, type of release, type of tendon, bond condition, concrete cover, surface condition and size of the section on the transmission length [311]. Moreover, this study will develop a finite element model to understand the influence of different parameters on the prestress transfer. The FE method on the other hand is much more effective in handling the complexities associated with material non-linearity and the structural behaviour in 3D.  The FE method has been used by other researchers to study the effects of the releasing techniques of prestressing steel on the stress field and cracks at the end zone [13]. The ANSYS FE package was also used to model pre-tensioned concrete beams and railway sleepers [14,15]. In the work of Ayoub and Filippou [17], the prestressing process was modelled across the different stages in the pre-tensioned concrete elements (i.e. prestressing, casting and releasing) using FE models in which an empirical local bond relationship was used. used values of 0.7 and 1.4 based on AASHTO LRFD shear friction design recommendations. The prestressing steel tries to shorten and expands due to Poissons ratio effect. This results in varying diameter within the transmission length in the shape of a wedge (                      Fig. As a result, the stress in steel increases gradually until it becomes constant beyond the transmission length (Fig. The prestressing steel is modelled as a solid cylinder with a radius that equals the nominal radius of prestressing steel (strand, bar, and wire). The prestress transfer in pre-tensioned concrete was model by examining the equilibrium, the compatibility and the bond conditions at each section. The bond between steel and concrete is modelled using Coulomb friction law. To find out the distribution of stresses in a prestressing bar along the transmission length, consider a small element dx subjected to radial pressure p, axial stress f                                                     p                          and bond stress as shown in                          Fig. Bond between steel and grout is attributed to three factors: (1) cohesion between steel and grout; (2) friction between steel and grout; and (3) mechanical resistance. Therefore, the friction between steel and grout is largely responsible for the transfer of stress into the surrounding material. Therefore, the transmission length can be predicted by substitution of stress f                                                     p                          in Eq. ( 8b illustrates the normal pressure at the interface between steel and concrete. A simple axi-symmetric FE model is developed using the ANSYS FE package [24]. Slip on the other hand occurs when the tangential distance between the pairs exceeds the specified tolerance. Values between 0.3 and 0.7 of the coefficient of friction are reported in literature [22]. Two solution algorithms are used to solve the contact between steel and concrete: (1) the augmented Lagrange multiplier method for solving normal contact behaviour; (2) the penalty method for solving tangential contact behaviour. The element size used in the mesh in this example is discretised into 200 divisions in the longitudinal direction (i.e. 15mm), and 3 divisions (i.e. 2.12mm) and 10 divisions (i.e. 3mm) in radial direction in the steel and concrete, respectively. However, there is a difference between the two models beyond the transmission zone. 11a and d. The presence of slip causes a drop in the bond stress, Fig. This indicates that cracks will be present in the radial direction in concrete; therefore the concrete is not expected to display true elastic behaviour after cracking. After prestress release, the radial stresses are always less than the compressive strength; hence, it is acceptable to use a linear model to describe the compressive behaviour of concrete. The post-cracking behaviour was modelled using the Hillerborgs fictitious cracking concept [29] assuming linear tension softening as shown in                             Fig. 32] to consider different strength evolution under concrete tension and compression. The typical value of the K                                                           c                             ratio for concrete is 2/3 [32]. To take such effects into account the dry shrinkage strain (                                                                                                                                                                                                               s                                     h                                                                                             ) was estimated at a given time in days (t) using the ACI 209 R-92 model [33], Eq. ( The Coulomb friction law was used to define the frictional behaviour between steel and concrete with a coefficient of friction of 0.4 and zero cohesion. Therefore, the global response may not be identical when different element sizes are used normal to the crack direction [31]. This is followed by the validations of the 3D FE model against previous experiments. The first step is prestressing where steel is tensioned (                            Fig. In this step, the distribution of stresses along its length remains constant and equals the prestress magnitude (Fig. After the setting of concrete, concrete shrinkage takes place causing a change to the stress profile in the pre-tensioned concrete member (Fig. The release of the prestressing force creates radial stress and activates a frictional resistance component which enhances the transfer of prestress force into the concrete (Fig. This behaviour enhances the transfer of prestress although it reduces the effective prestress (Fig. In this section, the model is examined whether it is able to predict this phenomenon or not. It is assumed that the direction of the maximum principal plastic strain is parallel to the direction of the vector normal to the crack plane [28]. To validate the proposed models, data were compared to previous experimental results [7,9]. The comparisons exhibit a good agreement between the model and experimental measurements. 20, the decrease of the slope of tendon stress (i.e. bond stress) can be related to the non-linear behaviour of concrete (i.e. bursting cracks), which is not considered in the analytical simulation. 9] the transmission length was estimated by predicting the transmission length at 95% of the average maximum strain (95% AMS), [5]. In the other hand the analytical model overestimate the transmission length by 11% based on ten specimens. This means that the ratio between characteristic upper and lower limit is 2.0, which indicated a high scatter in transmission length measurements in practice. These investigations were carried out on a large number of beams and took a considerable amount of time. Only less than 2% change was observed in the effective prestress in this case. In this investigation, it was found that later release of external prestress force results in shorter transmission length and up to 3% higher effective prestress,                          Fig. The developed 3D FE model was also used to examine the thick-wall cylinder assumption for prestressed concrete. This result is also supporting the findings in Section 7.5, which shows that the prestress transfer is not dependant on the size of the pre-tensioned concrete unit in the case of equal covers. Also the von Mises contours are plotted for the 200200mm2 beams with different concrete cover shown in Section 7.4 (                      Fig. The beams with smaller concrete cover show higher level of stress compare to those with the larger cover. The 3D non-linear FE model can be used as a tool to understand the phenomenon of prestress transfer considering different aspects. The presented parametric study, based on the 3D FE model, provides useful information about the influence of steel diameter, concrete cover, concrete strength, initial prestress, section size, member length, time of prestress releasing, and surface condition of the tendon on the transfer of prestress force from steel to concrete in pre-tensioned concrete elements.

15,15,S0168874X14001838," Stokes, Darcy and solid mechanics coupling is a matter of interest in many domains of engineering such as soil mechanics, bio-mechanics, and composites. The aim of this paper is to present a robust iterative method to deal with this coupling for low permeability media within the framework of industrial simulation, and especially for composite manufacturing processes. Stokes and Darcy problems are solved using a mixed velocitypressure finite element using a mini-element formulation, and coupled together by the so-called BeaversJosephSaffman conditions through their interface. This fluid formulation is then coupled to a non-linear solid mechanics formulation in finite deformations using Terzaghis law at the pore level, and an explicit dependence of permeability with respect to porosity that is exactly computed from the solid mechanics kinematics. Then, those formulations are validated with test-cases and by the Method of the Manufactured Exact Solution (MMES) (Knupp and Salari, 2003[1]). Finally, a 3D curved transient example of application is presented. ","This paper presents an iterative method to strongly couple Stokes and Darcy flows, in low permeability media, with finite strain solid mechanics in order to deal with fluid seepage into and out from low permeability media undergoing finite strains. Second, in a more general framework, some researchers chose to solve a fully three dimensional solidfluid mechanical formulation either through heavy monolithic approaches [19] or using an iterative method based on permeability and stress updates depending on displacementvelocity considerations [2,3]. The originality of the proposed method is that it remains robust and accurate even for real severe physical parameters such as low permeability values, thin pure fluid layer, large deformations and complex geometries which are often discarded in recent publications but definitively more relevant with respect to industrial applications. In addition, it is chosen to control the tangential velocity jump with a drag coefficient  leading to the BeaversJosephSaffman [20] condition. Indeed, the form of the Darcy problem allows us to separately solve for pressure and velocity fields [17]. This stabilization method has been validated on test cases in [2,3] for hierarchical bubble functions (P1+, see Fig. The flows are solved individually, in an iterative scheme, until equilibrium is reached at their interface. In such a case, typical in composite process simulation, the stabilization term                                                         p                          may not be negligible at all, leading to a non-zero velocity divergence in Stokes domain. 13) or                             [                                                                                                                                  C                                                                                                         pp                                                                                                                         ]                          in the global system (9). It confirms the good implementations of the coupling methods. 8                         , the pressure and velocity fields computed for                                                         =                            0                         , corresponding to Fig. Each computation was made over a more refined mesh (h is divided by 2) than the previous one starting with h=0.1 down to h=0.0125. 9                          shows isovalues of the numerical solution for pressure and for velocity, for h=0.0125. Finally, the good convergence rates and the good agreement with analytical results allow us to validate the implementation of the coupling algorithm and to confirm its robustness. Actually, the hyper-elastic orthotropic constitutive relationship is solved in a local reference system for each element to take into account the material orientations. Therefore the porosity can be directly computed from the mechanical rate of deformations. Indeed, the Stokes/Darcy coupled problem (see points                          2                       and                          3                       in Fig. Let us notice that the updated Lagrangian scheme adopted for the solid mechanics problem permits us to use the quasi-Eulerian stress field to compute the corresponding Terzaghi stress tensor [2,3]. Then, the deformation is reflected by the porosity variation modifying the permeability                                                                                                                                                            K                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             of the medium. 13                          shows the perfect agreement between analytical and numerical results. New elements filled between two time steps are determined from the flow rate calculated at the last known time step. In order to demonstrate the ability of the approach to handle industrial cases, the complete infusion simulation of a T stiffened panel is presented. Resin inlet is located in the center of the plate under the mould while the vent is in the center of the second distribution medium on the top of the T.  Preforms are made of 48,302 woven fabric from Hexcel Reinforcements constituted of T700 12k carbon fibers. The mesh used is composed of 8100 tetrahedrons and 1884 nodes. The preform is considered as an equivalent porous homogeneous medium (Darcy area), whose constitutive law has not been studied. However, for the example, we will assume that it obeys to the same behavior as fabric G1157 (UD plain) from Hexcel Reinforcement that has been extensively studied in [3436]. It may be noted that the areas of the part that have been impregnated in the in-plane direction (curvature and upper part of the T) present a linear swelling along time, while the plate and the base of the T, which have been impregnated transversely, have three distinct phases. Indeed, one can observe a first phase of filling with a small swelling. Then, when resin reaches the vacuum bag (top of the plate), a sharp increase of thickness occurs.

16,16,S0168874X14001735," This paper investigates several field transfer techniques that can be used to remap data between three-dimensional unstructured meshes, either after full remeshing of the computational domain or after mesh regularization resulting from an ALE (Arbitrary Lagrangian or Eulerian) formulation. The transfer is focused on state (or secondary) variables that are piecewise discontinuous and consequently only defined at integration points. The proposed methods are derived from recovery techniques that have initially been developed by Zienkiwicz et al. in the frame of error estimation. Obtaining a higher order interpolation with the recovered fields allows reducing the inescapable diffusion error resulting from the projection on the new mesh. Several variants of the method are investigated: (a) either based on nodal patches or on element patches, (b) by enforcing the balance equation in a weak sense or in a strong sense or not, (c) by using first or second interpolation orders. A special attention is paid to the accuracy of the transfer operators for surface values, which can play a first order role in several mechanical problems. In order to take into account the constraint due to parallel calculations, a new iterative approach is proposed. All methods are evaluated and compared on analytical tests functions, both for the ALE formulation and for full remeshings, before being applied to an actual metal forming problem. In all studied examples, in addition to improved accuracy, higher order convergence rates are observed both for volume and surface values, so providing quite accurate transfer operators for various applications. ","For a large class of nonlinear problems, such as forming processes or highly heterogeneous loadings, the optimal mesh configuration continually changes throughout the deformation process, requiring successive mesh adaptations during the numerical simulation. In Lagrangian formulations, it is activated at each remeshing step. The continuous variables (such as displacements, velocity and temperature) are often stored at nodes; they will be referred to as P1 variables in the present paper where a linear finite element interpolation is used. The techniques that are developed to transfer P1 variables are hardly applicable to P0 variables because of their discontinuous characteristic. The value at an integration point of the new mesh is directly copied from the nearest integration point of the old mesh. An approximated integration of the constructed function on the new grid is used to obtain the mean value in the cell. The general idea of this paper is that, whichever the utilized transfer operator and conservative as it can be, transfer always results into a loss of information due to diffusion during the change of mapping. This enrichment is derived from techniques which have initially been developed for error estimation based on the comparison between the finite element field and a recovered enhanced field, as originally proposed by Zienkiewicz and Zhu [11]. 17,18] developed a transfer operator based on the diffuse approximation, also referred to as the Moving Least Square method, which is both local and continuous over the entire domain. 22] used an iterative procedure to construct a smooth stress field to reduce numerical diffusion. 12,13] introduced the concept of Superconvergent Patch Recovery (SPR), where nodal field is evaluated by determining a polynomial expansion over a patch of elements sharing the node. In the present paper, eight transfer operators based on different interpolation approaches are formulated and tested against each other over benchmark problems. Therefore, this technique can be rather efficient, provided that the considered meshes are sufficiently refined with respect to the remapped fields. In the ALE formulation, remeshing occurs at each time step so the old and new meshes are very similar. Therefore, in order to minimize diffusion resulting from usual transfer techniques, interpolation can be avoided through a direct calculation of recovered fields on element patches, as for instance in [27,29]. In this paper, these two strategies are combined in order to handle any kind of meshes: if the enlargement of the patch (a) does not provide an invertible matrix then the order of the expansion (b) is reduced. This section is more specifically focused on the transfer of the stress tensor                                                      . 8) for any value of the interpolation coefficients                             a                                                                              g                         . In the present work, a slightly different approach is followed. 10), where h                                                     g                          is the size of central element and                          0 a large non-dimensional constant. The method is called REEP2 (Recovery by Equilibrium in Element Patches with 2nd order polynomial expansion). 3) is still used and consequently reduces the number of unknowns. The approach is quite similar to the method presented in Section 2.2. For linear finite element interpolation, and for any node k, the problem consists in finding the polynomial coefficients                             a                                                                              k                                                   (21) which allows recovering                                                      g                          values at any Gauss point of patch P                                                     k                                                   (22). Therefore, the consistency condition has to be enforced during the                                                                                                                                                                  (                               x                               )                             interpolation. It consists in adding a hierarchical bubble function to the P1 interpolation (15); it is built by considering the sub-tetrahedra of an element that are constructed from the central integration point and lie on its facets, as shown in                             Fig. Some arguments have been given by different researchers about which patch to choose when multiple neighbor patch solutions are available (l                            1 and l                            2 of Fig. However, it is preferable to reduce the interpolation order only in necessary directions (see Fig. On the other hand,  has to be small enough for minimizing the smoothing on                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                k                                                            provided by the regularization. On the other hand, first order neighbors can easily be computed within a parallel environment as described in next section. This method can regarded as an iterative way to enrich the size of the patch by addition of second order neighbor contributions. In the first iteration, the recovered values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     k                                                                                              can be only computed for the volume nodes and for a limited number of surface nodes. A third iteration can be necessary for the mesh edges, and a fourth one for mesh corners. Communications are only necessary for the nodes belonging to interfaces between partitioned domains. RESULTS   In order to test the performance of modified SPR operator (Section 3) to transfer data from one mesh to another, several analytical functions are considered (see                          Table 1 and                          Fig. The SPR approach is compared against the simple volumetric average based transfer operator (Avg) (Section 3.1, Eq. ( Several other meshes with uniformly decreasing mesh sizes are also considered in order to evaluate the convergence rate of the recovery procedures from Gauss point values to nodal values. It is more clearly presented in the loglog plots of                          Fig. It first shows that SPR approach produces less error, both at surface and inside the domain. For this particular function, the SPR operator is superconvergent with a convergence rate (1.9) of almost 2. Both recovery (P0P1) and transfer (P0P0) operators are evaluated. Regarding the recovery operation, it can be clearly seen from Table 1 that SPR converges nearly an order higher than Avg operator. Its rate is equal or larger than 2 for all tested functions, but it also approaches the value of 3 for some functions. On the other hand, SPR maintains it superconvergent nature for all studied functions. In other words, the stress tensor values at the four non-central Gauss points of the tetrahedra are computed from the values of                                                       at the centers of the elements. In other words, considering the balance equation in a weak form provides less efficient operators than using superconvergent properties, as has been noticed in error estimation [25]. Errors between the analytical and calculated translated pulses have been calculated after several of such transfers. It means that for a field resulting from finite element calculations, because this field will be adapted to mesh considered mesh refinement, the transfer error will be quite small and not noticeable from the isovalues. The mesh is too coarse to properly discretize this field, so the largest values are calculated on elements that are neighboring elements providing very low values; the gradient is especially steep on the surface. Therefore, by using the regularization (27) and by iteratively increasing the  value until the engineering constraint (29) is satisfied, quite acceptable values can be found, as shown in Fig. The obtained field is much smoother than with the original P0 interpolation; it is in better agreement with expected stress fields and it does not exhibit unrealistic gradients or values. As in previous example, the coarseness of the mesh results into a discontinuous stress field with steep gradient. For the transfer of stress tensor, the conservation of the balance equation is also shown to slightly increase the accuracy when it is enforced in a strong sense.

17,17,S0168874X14001711," A three-dimensional meso-mechanical model to study the debonding of FRP-to-concrete is described and then verified in this paper. The influence of the width of the FRP on the load-carrying capacity is investigated to understand the debonding mechanism of failure in such systems. Numerical simulations show that the progressive debonding of FRP plate bonded to concrete occurring beneath the FRP plate can be divided into four stages: elastic-deformation stage, the elastic-softening stage, the elastic-softening-debonded stage and softening-debonded stage. The numerical simulations indicate the development of high stress/strain gradients at the interface as a consequence of the relative slip between the FRP and the concrete. With the increase of the width of FRP plate, the interfacial bond strength and the slope of the initial elastic deformation of the load-global slip of FRP-to-concrete increases, the global slip is lower when increasing FRP width at the same stress level, by contrast, the total ultimate interfacial slip decreases with the increase of FRP plate width, and the interfacial ductility of FRP-to-concrete and the utilization efficiency of FRP plate also reduce. The reinforcement efficiency of the bonding of FRP plate in strips is higher than that of the bonding of FRP plate as a whole. In addition, the bending stress is of significant influence on the maximum principal stress at the loading end and near the plate edge and the debonding of FRP-to-concrete starts in the concrete beneath FRP plate near the edge of FRP plates and loading end. Numerical results on debonding of FRP-concrete visually reproduce the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of microcracking in FRP-to-concrete and reveal the distribution patterns of stress and strain in FRP plate and concrete, which is in good agreement with the existing experimental results in laboratory. Numerical simulations show that the numerical approach in the present study provides a useful tool for enhancing our understanding of debonding failure process and mechanism of FRP-concrete and our ability to predict mechanical performance and reliability of these FRP plate bonded to concrete structures. ","Strengthening reinforced concrete members using fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) has emerged as an efficient method to address strength deficiency problems. This approach has shown significant advantages compared to traditional methods, mainly due to the outstanding mechanical properties such as high tensile strength and stiffness of the FRP composites. Stress concentration may also result from the discontinuity near the ends of FRP. 8] renamed the four test methods as far end supported double-shear tests, near end supported double-shear tests, far end supported single-shear tests, and near end supported single-shear tests. Chen and Teng [6] compared the performance of eight of the models and pointed out the drawbacks of some of these models in predicting the experimental bond strengths. Freddi and Savoia [23] studied the problem of debonding of FRP plates glued over a concrete element using boundary integral equations and performed numerical simulation on FRP-concrete debonding problems using boundary element method. The real stresses near FRP-to-concrete interface are in three dimensional stress states due to the difference of width between FRP plate and concrete and the difference of the elastic modulus and Poissons ratio of FRP, adhesive and concrete. However, in the early numerical analysis the numerical model on FRP-to-concrete was assumed to be in plane stress state and a coefficient of width ratio was introduced to study the effect of various widths of FRP plate and concrete [19,2426], which is obviously different from the real three dimensional stress states. Reliable evaluation and prediction of damage onset/accumulation requires the quasi-random geometry model statistically close to the meso-structure of specific FRP bonded concrete. Finally, the debonding mechanism of FRP-concrete is also analyzed. In RFPA3D, the model is numerically discretized into regular cubic elements. The present model is, however, not intended as such a meso-mechanical model. Instead, the present model aims to use small elements to accurately track the development and propagation of cracks and the elements are still intended to represent the average performance of concrete. As we know, the FRP plates in reinforced concrete structures are normally used to carry tensile stresses. The modified MohrCoulomb criterion with tension cut-off is used as damage threshold so that the failure of the elements may be either in shear or in tension. The elastic modulus of damaged material is defined as follows. When the maximum tensile stress is reached and beyond the strength of the element, the tensile induced damage of element occurs. t                                  u                                                                                     is the ultimate tensile strain of the element, which indicates that the element would be completely damaged when the tensile strain of element attains this ultimate tensile strain. It is assumed that the damage of mesoscopic element in multiaxial stress field is also isotropic elastic, and therefore the above-described constitutive law for uniaxial tensile stress can be extended to three-dimensional stress states. The constitutive law of element subjected to multiaxial stresses can be easily obtained only by substituting the strain                                                       in Eq. ( 4) with equivalent strain                                                                                                                                               . Therefore, the maximum compressive principal strain                                                                                                                                                                                              3                                                                                     of damaged element is used to substitute the uniaxial compressive strain                                                       in Eq. ( The unloaded element keeps its original elastic modulus and strength. Concrete cubic specimens of 90mm50mm36mm were used in the simulations to save the computational efforts. The material properties for the concrete, GFRP used in Specimens III-7 and III-8 are adopted based on the experimental data [8,45]. The uniaxial tensile strength, elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strain of the GFRP composites are 351MPa, 22.5GPa, and 1.56%. The plain concrete block of nominal dimensions, length (70mm), width (50mm), and height (35mm) was used. The macroscopic material properties of the plain concrete are as follows: uniaxial compressive strength,                                                                                     f                                                                                       c                                                                           =30MPa, elastic modulus, E=30GPa and the ratio of uniaxial compressive strength to uniaxial tensile strength is 10. The physical and mechanical parameters of the numerical model at meso-scale are listed in                       Table 3. The approach also provides a useful way for understanding the debonding failure process and mechanism as only limited experimental observations of the debonding failure process can generally be made due to the microscopic details involved in and the suddenness of a debonding failure. At each step, the stress states in some elements may satisfy the strength criterion. As stated above, the debonding failure of FRP-to-concrete in laboratory is affected by a number of variables, such as the height of support, loading offset, the bond length and the width of FRP and concrete. Numerical simulations show that the debonding process of FRP plate bonded to concrete and the applied load versus global slip curves under various widths of FRP plates have a similar pattern. It can be obviously seen that in the initial stage of loading, significant bond stresses concentrated and developed near the loaded end of FRP plate in which the distribution of stress and deformation is basically uniform at a macroscopic scale (step 2 in Fig. Meanwhile, it can also be seen that the stress and deformation is approximately zero up to a large distance from the loading end (step 2 in Fig. 4 and 5 and the stress in FRP-to-concrete redistributes and transfers under the high tensile stress as can be seen in Fig. Finally, the bond stresses close to the loaded end are very small when full debonding happens, indicating the formation of a macro-crack. Based on the simulated stress and displacement deformation field evolution along the length FRP plate, the deformation distribution can thus be divided into three main zones: the unstressed zone, the stress transfer zone and the fully debonded zone. That is, the stiffness of FRP plate has a great influence on the initial stiffness of FRP-concrete. Similarly, the distribution curves of the maximum principal stress at the edge of FRP plate width are also similar. 11 shows the distribution of the maximum shear stress in the concrete with different homogeneity index but the same mean mechanical parameters at a mesoscale along FRP plate transverse direction at X=2mm and at the same load level. The maximum shear stress distribution curve becomes stable at about X=10. The maximum shear stress and the maximum tensile strain increase slowly from the midpoint (Y=0) of FRP plate width to the edge of the FRP plate along the transverse direction, peak near the edge of the FRP plate and then gradually drop to zero at the edge of the concrete. It follows that FRP-concrete debonding starts in concrete near the edge of FRP plates. CONCLUSION   Generally, it is difficult to thoroughly observe the interfacial debonding failure process of the FRP bonded to concrete in laboratory. The interface stress transfer between the FRP and concrete produces axial strain gradients in the FRP along its length. That is to say, the greater the width of FRP plate, the greater the slope of the initial elastic deformation of the load-global slip and the lower the interfacial ductility of FRP-to-concrete is. It is obviously inaccurate to study the debonding failure of FRP plate bonded to concrete by two-dimensional finite element analysis based on either plane stress or plane strain assumption due to the width effect of FRP plate and the non-uniformity of stress and strain in FRP plate and concrete. Moreover, AE events induced by elements failure accompanied by interfacial cracks growth can be taken as the precursor of macro-fracture of the specimens and acoustic emission is very useful in characterizing the different stages of microstructural damage.

18,18,S0168874X14001863," Meso-level finite element analysis (FEA) is a popular way to study the influences of meso-level structure of concrete (namely the aggregate, the mortar and the Interfacial Transitional Zone (ITZ) structures) on the macro-level properties. However, its been a huge challenge to mesh the ITZ structure in concrete because of the unique layer structure of ITZ, which is 1050m thick and rather small compared to the normal sizes of coarse aggregates. If ITZ were meshed by hexahedral elements or tetrahedral elements which were 1050m in all three dimensions, millions of ITZ elements would be generated and its impossible to perform FEA on such a huge concrete model. In the current meso-level FEA in the literature, ITZ is either represented by zero-thick interface elements or over-thick elements, either of which is far from the real dimension of ITZ, leading to big discrepancies between the numerical results and experimental results. In this paper a method to generate ITZ meshes called aggregate-expansion method (AEM) is proposed to generate wedge elements around 50m thick to represent ITZs layer structure. The total number of generated ITZ meshes is limited and acceptable in meso-level FEA for concrete. A digital concrete specimen is generated from CT images with ITZ meshes generated by AEM and effects of ITZ on the compressive stress/strain/displacement distributions of concrete were studied. The characteristics of stressstrain response of the digital concrete specimen under tension were also studied and compared with experimental data. ","Meso-level finite element analysis (FEA) is a popular and feasible way in studying the effects of mesostructures on the mechanical properties and durability of concrete, which is assumed to be a three-phase composite composed of coarse aggregates, mortar, and the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) between them. However, meshing ITZ remains a challenging issue since ITZ is only 1050m thick [2], which is rather small compared with the general dimensions of coarse aggregates (at least 5mm in diameter) in concrete specimens in the laboratory. So millions of meshes would be generated in three-dimensional FEA for concrete if the ITZ structure were meshed with ordinary solid elements that were 1050m in all three dimensions. Aggregate-expansion method (AEM) was proposed in this paper to generate wedge elements about 50m thick in an acceptable number that can represent the thin-layer structure of ITZ in FEA for concrete. 1(a) and (b) for example),                                                     i.                            Expand the surface of each aggregate by 50m. Update all the mortar elements that contain nodes on the original surface of the aggregate by replacing the original nodes with their corresponding new ones. Determine the total number of aggregates in the model (N), the node set of the surface of each aggregate (NodeSet-agg-surf), and the mortar element sets containing one, two and three nodes on the surface of each aggregate, respectively (EleSet-mor-surf-orig), based on the existing information of the mortar and aggregate elements and their corresponding nodes in the two-phase model. Determine the coordinates of the geometrical center (O) of the surface of each aggregate by averaging x/y/z coordinates of all the surface nodes. 1(a)) corresponding to the original surface nodes of aggregate i (like A, B,C, in Fig. Get the ITZ element set (EleSet-itz-i) by numbering the wedge elements (such as ABCABC in Fig. All the CT images were 512pixel512pixel in dimension and the spatial resolution was about 0.4mm, which satisfied the needs of reconstructing coarse aggregates. Ignoring voids, there were only two components (aggregates and mortar) left on each image and only one component needed to be segmented before reconstruction, for the whole concrete structure was easy to be reconstructed and thus the other component could be obtained through the Boolean subtraction operation. 2), some of the adjacent aggregates were connected to their neighbors in the mask. Thus manual editing of the mask had to be done to refine the aggregate outlines. Once the segmentation procedure was completed for all the 2D CT images, the 3D aggregate structure could be obtained according to the image reconstruction function based on the surface-rending algorithm in MIMICS. The mortar surface could be easily obtained by subtracting the aggregate surface from the cylinder specimen, as seen in Fig. However, the fine meshes had to be re-meshed via Remesher module in MIMICS to get their quality raised, so that tetrahedral meshes could be generated in the preprocessor of ABAQUS. Perspective views of the mortar surface before and after the re-meshing procedure were shown in                             Fig. 4 that the meshes became uniform in dimension after re-meshing, which makes generation of tetrahedral meshes in the following procedure possible. If yes, this element belongs to the same aggregate surface which the first element belongs to, and it will be deleted from the link list after its corresponding nodes are recorded. Repeat steps ii and iii till no element left in the link list. The three-phase digital concrete generated in the above method (hereinafter referred as the three-phase digital concrete) had great potential in meso-mechanical analysis of concrete, because of its three advantages over other digital concrete also constructed from CT images found in the literature (as shown in                       Table 1). 6), enabling direct meso-mechanical studies of concrete based on clearly defined material law of ITZ rather than creating a new black box material law. Moreover, the agreement between the calculated elastic modulus and the experimental results was quite satisfactory. Especially for case 1, the relative error of elastic modulus was between 0.3% (E                         itz=0.5E                                                     m                         ) and 0.7% (E                         itz=0.7E                                                     m                         ) while the volume fraction of aggregates was 1.8% smaller than that in the experimental data. Brittle cracking model [28] is employed in the numerical tests to simulate the damaging and failure behavior of mortar and ITZ under tension. 11(a) that the inelastic stage in the stressstrain curve starts with the emerging and developing of ITZ microcracks resulting from the lower tensile strength of ITZ. Results of the numerical tests showed that with solid wedge elements representing ITZ the unique features of concrete under tension, such as the nonlinear response before peak stress and the tension-softening response accompanied with initiation and development of ITZ and mortar microcracks, can be effectively captured.

19,19,S0168874X14001851," The arc welding process involves thermal cycles that cause the appearance of undesirable residual stresses. The determination of this thermal cycle is the first step to a thermomechanical analysis that allows the numerical calculation of residual stresses. This study describes the formulation of a 2D finite element with through the thickness parabolic temperature distribution, including an element estabilization procedure. The 2D element described in this paper can be used to perform thermal analysis more economically than 3D elements, especially in plates, because the number of degrees of freedom through the thickness will always be three. A numerical model of a tungsten arc welding (GTAW) setup was made based on published experimental results. Size and distribution of the heat source input, thermal properties dependent on temperature, surface heat losses by convection and latent heat during phase change were considered. In parallel the same setup was modeled using ANSYS software with 3D elements (SOLID70) to compare against 2D numerical results. The results obtained by 2D model, 3D model and experimental data showed good agreement. ","Welding is a fabrication process widely used in industry, being employed in various industries such as petrochemical, aerospace, automotive, marine and others. This strong thermal gradient is responsible for the appearance of undesirable residual stresses and consequent deformations. The FE results obtained by Long were compared with experimental data and empirical predictions, showing reasonable agreement. Bergman and Oldenburg [10] proposed a thermal shell element with in-plane linear variation of temperature and quadratic variation along the thickness. Another major difference is that the present element has a stabilization scheme which permits the use of relatively coarse meshes to successfully obtain accurate results in the presence of thermal shocks or in regions where high temperature gradients are known to exist. In this zone the heat source is located on the top surface of the welded plate whereas the bottom surface is often modeled to be in natural convection. It will be shown that the 2D element proposed may be prone to numerical illness. In order to be economical in terms of degrees of freedom the element is 4-noded and has bilinear shape functions over its local plane xy. The units of T                                                     a                         , T                                                     b                          and T                                                     c                          are not the same since they are multiplied by 1, z and z                         2, respectively. These can be calculated for each element e and its domain                                                      e                         . 5) is more elaborate since it requires computation of T and T. This is achieved, again, using Eq. ( Moreover, one of the most attractive features of the FE method is its ability to approximate solutions with a relatively small number of simple elements. 24) and (19) reveals the error incurred when the numerical FE solution is adopted: the coefficient in T                                                     b,i                          is wrong. In the case of 2D problems the correction depends on the element area A                                                     e                          and is given by =hA                                                     e                                                  k                                                     zz                                                  cosh(r)/6. The most basic time integration procedure available is the forward Euler method. A more general approach, called generalized midpoint method, consists in evaluating Eq. ( Different values of  lead to different time marching schemes. The phase change process in the weld pool needs to absorb or release thermal energy described by latent heat. In the moving mesh method the phase change interface is determined as a moving boundary and solid and liquid region are analyzed separately.

The heat source is composed of a front half formed with a quadrant of an ellipsoid, and a rear half composed by a quadrant of another ellipsoid (                         Fig. The other edges of the plate are kept at 0C. This heating condition is maintained for 5s, and then the temperature imposition is removed from the hot side, causing the cooling of the plate. In this example the thermal properties were considered constant, making the problem linear: c=900J/kgC, =2700kg/m3 and k=237W/mC. The initial plate temperature is 0C and the convection coefficient h is zero on all surfaces. 12 shows the temperature history for the thickness located at x=0.001m and y=0.05m. The temperature-dependent thermal conductivity is shown in                          Fig. Based in the weld pool obtained by Depradeux the parameter c of Eq. ( In the weld region the elements have 0.0010.001m2 dimension and gradually increase to 0.010.001m2. The temperature field calculated by the new 2D element at 85s and 230s are shown in                       Fig. 20 and 21 show the numerical results obtained with 2D code, 3D Ansys model and experimental setup (Depradeux). 20 and 21 that there is a good agreement between the numerical results and the measured data. The greatest variations between the models occurs in the points near weld line, where there is a high gradient of temperature. Before and also after the passing of the torch, the difference between the curves is small, which is an evidence that the parabolic approximation of temperature on thickness adopted in the development of the 2D model is reasonable. A 3D model of ANSYS thermal analysis was developed in parallel to compare the numerical results, focusing on the temperature distribution in the thickness.",0.7588898525585429,0.1577713667508114,0.2612339913553956,0.05239520958083832,0.21084337349397592,0.08393285052855569,0.16890080428954424,0.5478260869565217,0.25819671770903324
20,20,S0168874X14001887," The entire glass sheet forming process consists of heating and forming a glass sheet and cooling and tempering it afterwards. For the first step, the glass sheet is heated using a local radiative source and deforms by sagging. In the thermo-mechanical calculations, temperature dependent glass viscosity, heat exchange with the ambient air and radiative source effects should be considered. A two-dimensional finite element model with plane deformation assumptions is developed. Using the P1-Approximation, the formulation and numerical resolution of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) are performed on the glass domain as it changes over time to estimate the flux of the radiative body at each position in the glass. In the next step, the sheet is cooled. Narayanaswamys model is used to describe the temperature dependent stress relaxation and the structural relaxation. The RTE is again solved using the P1-Approximation to consider the internal radiative effects during the cooling. There is a discussion using the P1-Approximation and comparing the results to other existing methods for the temperature changes of the glass throughout the forming process, for the deformed shape at the end of the forming step and for the residual stresses after tempering. ","Glass is a semi-transparent material with highly temperature dependent mechanical and thermal behaviors. On the other hand, the model would also need to solve the mechanical problem with the temperature dependent viscosity of the glass and the changing contact conditions imposed by the forming tools. For specific applications, glass must be tempered to make it more resistant and safer. Another solution consists of using the Stefan-Boltzmanns law and considering only surface radiation [9]. The Rosselands approximation treats thermal radiation as a correction of heat conductivity, which is computed before the FEM computation using absorption coefficients. This is why the method is valid only for optically thick glass.",0.3412322274881517,0.5958620689655172,0.4339537412356155,0.09523809523809523,0.05747126436781609,0.0716845831194361,0.28205128205128205,0.2,0.23404254833635138
21,21,S0168874X14001899," In the present work an aero-elastic model is presented to study flutter and divergence of isotropic plate wings. A finite element model is subsequently developed to apply the theoretical model and predict the performance of plate wings. A divergence analysis is carried out using the finite element model combined with the vortex lattice method for aerodynamic load calculations. The flutter analysis is carried out using a finite element model combined with the doublet lattice method. The aerodynamic model is coupled to the structural model using the shape (interpolation) functions of the finite element model. Static condensation is used to express the finite elements in-plane degrees of freedom in terms of the bending ones, hence reducing the number of the elements degrees of freedom per node to three. A MATLAB code is developed to implement the proposed model using three-node triangular finite elements. The present model is validated using benchmark problems available in the literature, and the effects of taper ratio on both divergence and flutter speeds and flutter frequency are studied.

Su and Cesnik [8] examined a flying wing aero-elastic characteristics using the finite element method. Hollowell and Dugundji [9] demonstrated experimental and analytical analyses for a composite plate wing. An instability analysis was carried out using the V-g method [10]. The structural analysis is performed using beam model while the aerodynamic analysis is obtained using the 2-D aerodynamic theories. The solution of the aero-elastic equation was obtained using NewtonRaphson method. There are various methods used to determine the aerodynamic forces on lifting surfaces. The boundary condition for each horseshoe vortex is satisfied by requiring the inclination of the fluid streamline to match the angle of attack at the three-quarter-chord point of its elemental panel.

Therefore the five degrees of freedom in q are reduced to the bending degrees of freedom w                                                     s                          using static condensation as shown in Appendix A. Thus, we have the stiffness and mass matrices expressed in terms of the bending degrees of freedom. In this article, the aerodynamic model and the finite element model are coupled.

To test the present model the results are compared with those obtained in reference [6]. Table 1 shows the divergence and flutter speeds at different sweep angles, where the positive angles represent sweep-back and the negative angles represent sweep-forward, for the present model as compared with those of Ref. [ First, the present model used the vortex lattice method for steady aerodynamic analysis and the doublet lattice method for unsteady aerodynamic analysis, while in the other model the doublet point method was used for both the static and dynamic analyses. The present model and the developed program are designed to analyze wings having different geometries including wings with different sweep angles and taper ratios. The study is carried out for different taper ratios (TR), where TR=Ct/Cr, ranging from 1 (untapered wing) to 0.2 (highly tapered wing). It is seen that while the results are different from those of Table 2, they have the same trends. A finite element model is developed to analyze the behavior of isotropic plate wings with different geometries subjected to aerodynamic loading. An accurate technique for mapping the loads calculated at the aerodynamic control points to the finite element mesh is proposed. In this technique the shape functions of the finite element model are used to perform this mapping. The model is also used to study the effect of the plate wing taper ratio on the divergence and flutter speeds. In the first case, there are significant increase in the divergence and flutter speeds of the plate wing with the increases of the wing taper. This is consistent because the increase in wing taper decreases the area of the wing tip, which increases the stiffness of the wing that leads to the increase in the wing divergence and flutter speeds.",0.5828082808280828,0.3073819131260384,0.4024873572728784,0.1288888888888889,0.23770491803278687,0.16714696950394087,0.24180327868852458,0.4338235294117647,0.31052631119335183
22,22,S0168874X14002005," In topology optimization of a continuum under multiple loading cases (MLC), if the magnitudes of loads are different obviously, it is hard to obtain a clear component to support the weaker loads. Such MLC are called ill-loading cases (ILC). A new method is presented to solve the layout optimization of a continuum with bi-modulus material under multiple loading conditions (MLC) by using a Q-norm weighting objective which is formed with the Q-norm of weighted structural compliances of MLC. The effects both of the value of Q and bi-modulus behavior of material on the final material distribution are studied. Both of validity and efficiency of the present algorithm are discussed numerically. Results show that the optimal bi-modulus material distribution of a structure under serious ILC can be found if using a small positive value of Q within interval of [0.1, 0.2] and the computational efficiency is very close to that of traditional isotropic material layout optimization. ","Layout/topology optimization is a powerful tool for the conceptual design of a structure/composite material. However, the computational cost of topology optimization is usually very heavy as comparing with size/shape optimization. 3], evolutionary structural optimization method (ESO) by Xie and Steven [4] and level set method (LST) by Wang et al. [ On the other hand, material replacement methods are also suggested [1116] in layout optimization of a continuum as the different behavior in tension and compression exists. Further, the effects of both the value of the power exponent and bi-modulus behavior of material on the optimal topologies are to be discussed numerically. And Q-norm weighting scheme is presented to solve topology optimization of a continuum under MLC. c                                                     w                          denotes the weighted structural compliance under N                                                     LC                          types of loading conditions. Q(0, ) is power exponent for weighting scheme which is different from that given by Luo et al. [ c                                                                                                                  i                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            is the modified structural compliance under the i-th loading condition. Take E                                                     T                         =tan                          and E                                                     C                         =tan                          as the tensile modulus and compressive modulus of bi-modulus material, respectively. However, the elasticity shows orthotropic with unset material principal directions if the bi-modulus material is under complex stress states. Therefore, the feasible way to overcome this difficulty is to define several stress-independent materials to replace the original bi-modulus material. In simulation, the original bi-modulus material is replaced with isotropic materials in structure. This conclusion is obtained based on the same amount of material in both elements. f                                                     m                          is the modification factor of the m-th element for the reason of material replacement and is given in Eq. ( In all of the following simulation, the same computer (Intel Pentium Dual-Core processor/CPU 2.66GHz/2GB Memory) with the same computational setting is used. In the first loading condition, the concentrated force P                         1=1000N is applied on the center of top with weighting coefficient of w                         1. The objective is to obtain the optimal material distribution with minimal structural mean compliance with volume constraint, i.e., f                                                     v                          in Eq.

It is the major reason why the topologies in conditions (b), (d) and (f) are the same. The initial design of structure shown in                          Fig. It implies that lower value of Q can decrease the effects of the difference between loads on material distribution of structure. In practical engineering, selection of the weighting coefficients is commonly dependent on the frequencies of loading cases [27], and should not be carried out randomly. For finding a common method to obtain the value of Q, dimensionless analysis is presented. The amount of material under compression in the final structure should be as higher as possible. 15 implies that the amount of material to support P                            2 increases when Q decreases. 15b further demonstrates that the value of Q can be set to be 0.2 to find the practical optimal topology when r                                                           P                            =100. 17 gives the optimal topologies of structure under single load case. It shows that three final structures (cases (a), (c) and (e)) are different and the amount of material to support P                            2 increases with the value of Q. In the right column, the structures are different from the left structures clearly because of the difference between tension modulus and compression modulus of bi-modulus material. For the same structure with bi-modulus material (right column of Fig. But the average CPU time for each iteration is 77.14s for cases (b) and (d), and 74.69s for case (f). CONCLUSIONS   From numerical discussions given above, the present method can be used to find the optimal stiffness design for a structure under MLC when the material in design domain shows bi-modulus. (1)                            For a symmetric structure subjected to weighted symmetric loading conditions (e.g., right columns in Figs. One is that the upper bound should be valid for dealing with the common ill-loaded structural topology optimization, in which the minimal load is about 0.01 to 0.1 times of the maximal load. The lower bound of interval is determined by the practical requirements.

23,23,S0168874X14001991," This paper evaluates various Finite Element (FE) models for the static and dynamic analyses of single- and multi-bay metallic box structures. Load factors are considered in the static response, whereas free vibration analyses are addressed to compare the dynamic performances. Different FE models able to include cross-sectional deformations are compared. These comprise solid (3D) and plate/shell (2D) models, which are obtained by using a general-purpose commercial software. Results related to a hierarchical variable kinematic beam (1D) formulation, which opportunely degenerates into classical beam theories with rigid-cross section assumptions (e.g. EulerBernoulli and Timoshenko), are also addressed. Displacements as well as axial and shear stress fields are compared for various loading cases. Regarding dynamic analyses, fundamental and higher-order natural frequencies by various models are computed and the Modal Assurance Criterion is used to compare the eigenmodes. It is concluded that refined models are mandatory to accurately describe the static and dynamic characteristics of thin-walled box structures. Classical and lower-order refined beam models show severe limitations in capturing localized stress/strain fields as well as local mode shapes. Nevertheless, the accuracy of lower-order models is improved as a consequence of the adoption for transverse ribs, which lead to more rigid cross-sections. ","Thin-walled box beams are widely used in many fields of the engineering and their major applications are those related to aerospace, civil, automotive and naval constructions. 1D CUF theories have received considerably attention in the past and recent years. The capabilities of TE models in dealing with higher-order phenomena (e.g. constraint warping, cross-sectional deformations, torsion and coupling effects) have been demonstrated in recent papers for both static [3638] and dynamic [3942] analyses. Furthermore, both TE and LE CUF models have been extended to include load factors [49] and non-structural masses [50] in recent works. According to the generalized Einstein notation, the repeated subscript, , indicates summation. The choice of                                                                                     F                                                                                                                                                                   determines the class of the 1D CUF model that has to be adopted. The refined TE models described above are characterized by degrees of freedom (displacements and N-order derivatives of displacements) with a correspondence to the axis of the beam (see Fig. It is therefore possible to obtain refined beam models without changing the formal expression of the nuclei components. The geometrical data are as follows: a=0.8m, h=0.2m, t=0.01m. In particular, the results by EBBM and TBM are shown in rows 3 and 4 of Table 1. 5 the Lagrange nodes are not depicted; each rectangle represents an L9 element. In the last column of Table 1 the number of the degrees of freedom (DOFs) is also given for each model implemented. A comparison between different models can be appreciated in Fig. As it is known, cross-section in-plane deformations are neglected by classical beam models, which are therefore not suitable for the problem under consideration. The results from LE models are able to detect the solid solution as demonstrated by the results in Table 1 and Figs. The cross-section discretization refinement for LE models is an effective method that leads to the 3D solution. A TE model with at least a sixth-order expansion (N=6) is necessary to obtain acceptable results if uniform gravity loads are considered. The 2D model, although characterized by almost the same number of DOFs of 1D LE models, is not able to catch the 3D results. MAC values between the 16L9 and 3D eigenmodes are graphically shown in a matrix form in Fig. The following remarks can be made:                                                           1.

The MAC matrix shows a perfect correspondence between LE and 3D models. In the first load case, a point load F                                                     z                         =500N was applied at (                            a                            ,                            L                            ,                            h                            /                            2                         ). 18                          shows the deformation of the tip cross-section by different models. 19                          shows the distributions of shear stress                                                      xy                         . The structure is more rigid as a consequence of the addition of the ribs. This aspect is clear since the reduction of the committed error with respect to displacement components. In the second load case the structure underwent the acceleration field shown in Fig. Classical and TE models are not taken into account because of their ineffectiveness for the problem under consideration. These structures are, in fact, more rigid within their cross-sectional planes. The mean percentage error with respect to the reference solid solution is about 2% if refined beams are used. The same error was equal to 10% in the case of the single-bay un-ribbed box. Moreover, the computational efforts demanded by this approach are significantly lower than those required by the solid model. The vibrations of the two-bay box beam were further investigated. Conversely, high bending frequencies are not detected since local phenomena occur. The results show that classical and lower-order TE beam theories are ineffective in analysing box cross-section beams.",0.6692415730337079,0.2091288128154487,0.3186767704409431,0.05045045045045045,0.1497326203208556,0.07547169434307384,0.16772151898734178,0.40458015267175573,0.23713646118082773
24,24,S0168874X14002017," In this study, an effective p-version two-node mixed finite element is newly presented for predicting the free vibration frequencies and mode shapes of isotropic shells of revolution. The present element considering shear strains is based on ReissnerMindlin shear deformation shell theory and HellingerReissner variational principle. To improve the accuracy and resolve the numerical difficulties due to the spurious constraints, field-consistent stress parameters are employed corresponding to displacement shape functions with high-order hierarchical shape functions. The elimination of stress parameters and the reduction of the nodeless degrees by the Guyan reduction yield the standard stiffness and mass matrix. Results of the proposed element are compared with analytical, experimental and numerical solutions found in the literature. We can confirm a very satisfactory numerical behavior of the present p-version mixed element. ","of hierarchical high-order displacement functions and field-consistent stress parameters yield locking-free and accurate numerical results. This harmonic axisymmetric shell element has one major advantage that the uncoupled circumferential harmonics make the analysis be performed independently for each harmonic. To overcome these problems, many techniques such as the selective/reduced integration finite element [16,17], the field-consistent element [15], the spline finite element [1821], and the mixed finite element [2224] have been proposed. The present element is based on the first-order ReissnerMindlin shear deformation shell theory and the HellingerReissner variational principle. The numerical performance of the present mixed element is evaluated in several examples. These numerical tests for comparison to available solutions in the literatures show that the present element has satisfactory convergence and accuracy in the free vibration analysis for shells of revolution.

It can be seen that the results obtained by using only four elements show satisfactory agreement with those of Luah and Fan [21] by six spline finite elements. Torispherical heads are used commonly in large pressure and containment vessels because of their simple manufacturing and good strength in high pressure condition. 7 represents the comparison of first meridional vibration mode shapes corresponding to the circumferential harmonic number n=1, 2, 3 with those by ANSYS. The introduction of hierarchical high-order shape functions related to nodeless degrees in the displacement field and field-consistent stress parameters can make possible to develop an effective element improving the numerical performance substantially as well as removing the locking phenomena. The several numerical results demonstrate that the mixed element (                         m                                                  2                      ) proposed herein can be applied with credibility to treating practical shells of revolution efficiently.

25,25,S0168874X14001905," This paper presents a multiscale finite element homogenization technique (MFEH) for modelling nonlinear deformation of multi-phase materials. A novel condensation technique to relate force variations acting on the representative volume element (RVE)  involving antiperiodicity of traction forces at RVE corners  and displacement variations on boundary-nodes is proposed. The formulation to accommodate the condensation technique and overall tangent modulus is presented in detail. In this context, the effective homogenised tangent modulus is computed as a function of microstructure stiffness matrix which, in turn, depends upon the material properties and geometrical distribution of the micro-constituents. Numerical tests concerning plastic materials with different voids distributions are presented to show the robustness of the proposed MFEH. ","The heterogeneous nature of materials has a significant impact on the observed macroscopic behaviour of multi-phase materials. They appeared due to the complexity of microstructural mechanical and physical behaviour along with the developments of computational techniques. These approaches have been used in a large number of applications, see [1418]. Since the basic principles for the micromacro modelling of heterogeneous materials were introduced (see [22,11,2325]), this technique has proved to be the most effective way to deal with arbitrary physically non-linear and time dependent material behaviour at micro-level. Although our study is confined to the finite element method, they allow any modelling technique on the microlevel. The paper is structured as follows: Firstly, the necessary background is presented. A discrete model of the macro and microstructure is considered in Fig. The overall macroscopic deformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        is prescribed over the discretised RVE. Therefore, the variation of the Taylor displacement is zero during the iteration                          d                                                                                    u                                                                                                                                                                     =                         0                      , because it is applied at the beginning of the process. Another approach is to condense the microstructural stiffness matrix to the macroscopic matrix tangent modulus. This task is achieved by reducing the total RVE system of equations to the relation between the forces acting on the boundary                                                         V                          and the displacement on the boundary. In view of the discrete formulation of the boundary conditions outlined, the nodes of the mesh are partitioned into those on the surface                                                   V                       of RVE and those in the interior of                          V                      , see Fig. Note that by using (34) the overall tangent modulus can be computed for heterogeneous material with different microstructures. In Section 4 a general solution scheme for microequilibrium was given. n                                                                                                                  p                                                                                                       negative boundary nodes which are located at the bottom and left side of the microstructure surface                                                                     V                                of RVE. n                                                                                                                  c                                                                                                       node at the corners. The underlying idea relies on the antiperiodicity of force in the corners that come from the different continuum distributions. The equilibrium and antiperiodicity equation at the corners of the discretised RVE is given by (77) which is imposed to compute the overall tangent modulus. In this section, the particularisation of the microequilibrium procedure for periodic b.c. Square microcells, in which fibres are periodically distributed, are considered composed of epoxy matrix with Youngs modulus E=3.13GPa and Poissons ratio =0.34. Especially, the periodic assumption seems to be very accurate. The second numerical test considered is an analysis of nonlinear material behaviour in small strain. The properties of the material are as follows:                                                                                 Youngs modulus E=210GPa. Microstructure 2: Square void in the middle of the RVE with 5% volume fraction. Curved denoted Lubliner represents the closed-form solution described above and given in [30]. It can be observed that the material response softens when the void volume fraction increases. The Taylor assumption gives less sensitive results than linear b.c. The circular evolution of the plastic front at macroscale level can be observed. For P=175MPa a slight distortion of the plastic front is visible as the load approaches the limit value. for values of internal pressure of P=95 and P=150MPa, respectively. are shown for Microstructure 2 for values of internal pressure of P=100 and P=160MPa, respectively, while Fig. 18                         (a) and (b) gives the result for the periodic b.c. Two different stages are depicted for different values of internal pressure P=115 and P=160MPa, respectively. In this section tables with the Euclidean norm                                                                                              R                                                                                                M                                                                                     of the residual are reported associated with the Newton iterations of the macro- and micro-equilibrium. The main novelty of MFEH lies in the way that boundary-node forces at the corners are condensed in order to achieve a macro-consistent tangent operator: anti-periodic boundary conditions in terms of traction vectors at the corners of the RVE leading to quadratic rate of convergence in the Macrostructure. The new effective macroscopic tangent modulus is consistent with the boundary conditions.",0.8105882352941176,0.119245413637937,0.2079068315934617,0.03046594982078853,0.1574074074074074,0.05105104833373928,0.14420062695924765,0.5476190476190477,0.22828783789124993
26,26,S0168874X14001978," In this paper, numerical modelling of isothermal solutal melting and solidification in binary systems is done using a new meshfree interface-finite element method (MI-FEM) where the implicitly represented liquidsolid interface is allowed to arbitrarily intersect the finite elements. A meshfree radial basis functions (RBFs) method is used for solving a distance-regularized level set (DRLS) equation such that re-initialization is completely eliminated and fast marching algorithms for interfacial velocity extension are not necessary resulting in a more efficient solution with excellent volume conservation. In the proposed method, intersection points between the mesh and the zero level set are used as meshfree nodes such that at the interface-embedded elements interpolants are constructed using meshfree RBFs ensuring both the partition of unity and Kronecker-delta properties are satisfied allowing for precise and easy imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions (DBCs) on each side of the interface. A coupling of the MI-FEM with a new meshfree automata (MA) method is used to efficiently predict the microstructural evolution during solidification. Benchmark problems with strong discontinuities were solved where very good accuracy was obtained. The solute conservation and interfacial equilibrium equations describing solutal phase transformation in binary systems were solved using the newly developed method. Mathematical formulation and implementation followed by numerical results and analysis will be presented and discussed. ","Solutal phase transformation is an isothermal diffusion-controlled process such that under certain process parameters melting of the solid or, conversely, solidification of the liquid will occur. Careful selection of bonding parameters is essential in order to avoid inferior mechanical and thermal properties of the finished product. Incomplete melting of additive powder particles during transient liquid phase bonding of single crystals results in stray grain formation which introduces grain boundaries into the single crystal along with their inherent weaknesses making the material more susceptible to grain boundary corrosion and sliding [25]. The complex topological evolution of the interface and handling of interfacial dynamics such as merging and splitting makes numerical analysis quite challenging. It is important to note that since the interfacial evolution is now independent of the underlying mesh, a finite element formulation used to calculate the field variables must account for the inter-element discontinuities where the interface may arbitrarily intersect the elements. The relatively recent generalized/extended finite element methods (GFEM/XFEM) based on the Partition of Unity method (PUM) developed by Melenk and Babuska [21] are excellent techniques for handling both weak and strong discontinuities that may arbitrarily intersect the finite elements. This is mainly due to the flexibility of the PUM for inclusion of pre-determined analytical solutions as enrichment functions which significantly facilitates handling of singularities that arise at crack tips during crack propagation analysis. This term is dependent on a stabilization parameter that scales the impact of stabilization. To overcome the volume loss issue in level sets, Enright et al. [ Negative particles are located on the negative side of the interface while positive particles on the other. While the particle LSM effectively solves the mass/volume conservation issues with the classical level set method, it is computationally intensive since the re-initialization and velocity extension steps are still required along with advecting, deleting and addition of the virtual particles. 44] reported that this approach preserves the LSF to remain as a SDF which deemed the re-initialization procedure unnecessary. While the computational aspects of PF methods can be relatively mitigated by the use of parallel processing and more powerful processors, it still has the limitation that the PF solution converges to the true sharp-interface solution only when the diffuse interface thickness is very thin. Our goal in this work is to further develop this approach for tackling phase transformation problems. Due to the diffusion of the solute, the liquidsolid interface must migrate to ensure mass balance. If the sign of                                                       is different at any two nodes of an elements edge, then the interface must intersect that edge. Interpolation function construction at the intersected element using meshfree techniques which satisfy both the partition of unity and the Kronecker-delta properties. Technically however, any meshfree technique which satisfies the partition of unity property can be applied for constructing the interpolation functions at intersected elements. The meshfree POU method used for computing the approximation functions                                                         (                                                                                             x                                                                                                j                                                                                       )                          does not immediately satisfy the Kronecker-delta condition which complicates the manner of imposing DBC directly at the interface. For the purpose of the present work, we choose radial point interpolation using RBF for constructing the interpolation functions for elements intersected by the interface which inherently exhibit the Kronecker delta property in addition to the partition of unity requirement [5153]. In other words, only support nodes that belong to the same phase or the interface are used for interpolation. The impact of the second problem is significantly reduced since meshfree construction of interpolants is only done at the interface-embedded elements. To construct the meshfree interpolants, N                                                     RBF                         , at the interface-embedded elements, RBFs are employed as discussed next. 35] for computing the interface velocity profile for dendritic growth simulations. As mentioned earlier, solution of the LSF using standard Galerkin finite element methods will often yield unstable solutions. Unfortunately, even the use of stabilization schemes does not prevent the deterioration of the LSF from a SDF. As mentioned earlier, this re-initialization method results in parasitic interfacial movement that is un-physical and unrelated to the physics of the problem which violates mass and volume conservation laws. The diffusion term forces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          to 1 to maintain the signed distance property. To solve the DRLS function, we still need to determine a velocity function V                                                     n                                                                              ext                          such that Eq. ( The basic idea is to sweep the front ahead in an upwind fashion by considering a set of points in a narrow band around the existing front and to march this narrow band forwards, locking the values of existing points and bringing new ones into the narrow band. Due to the following properties of the proposed approach:                                                           1. This reduces the computational time especially if the size of the interface is significantly smaller than the total size of the computational domain. Consider a case of solidification where simultaneous growth of multiple solid phases each with                                                         <                            0                          occurs. The presented MI-FEM so far can only predict the evolution and location of solid regions but not their crystallographic orientation. However, since only the solid fraction is tracked, not the interface itself, curvature can only be roughly approximated using a counting-cell method such as that proposed by Nastac [64]. In the present work, no secondary CA grids imposed on the FE mesh are needed. To clarify, during pre-processing, random MA points are generated inside all elements. During a simulation, only automata points within an embedded element and its immediately adjacent elements are set to a state of alive. Once the future solution of the DRLS has been computed, as shown in Fig. 6                         , a liquid MA point (shown as green points) at an initial time t=0 with spin index S=0 and                                                         >                            0                          will have LSF values                                                         <                            0                          at the next time step. This can be obtained by interpolating the LSF values of the vertices of the bounding element. To solve the problem, for a given fixed unstructured or structured mesh where a SDF which implicitly defines the liquidsolid interface has been generated the following computational algorithm is implemented:                                                           1. Using the distribution of the LSF, update the global matrices at embedded elements by constructing RBF interpolants using nodes of the embedded elements and nodes of adjacent elements as support nodes. Using the final converged solution of the LSF, evolve the MA points at interface-embedded elements to determine the microstructure. It is clear from the algorithm that the implicit LSF governs the handling of inter-element discontinuities and interfacial evolution. Therefore, in this section we present solutions to benchmark problems involving strong discontinuities where the exact solution is already known. This is consistent with the conclusions by Wang and Liu [54] who reported that optimal shape parameter for GE-RBF yielding best accuracy is in the range 0.030.003. 66], Larsson and Fornberg [67], and Schaback [68] who studied this behaviour of the multiquadric and Gaussian exponential interpolants. An implicitly defined interface arbitrarily intersecting the elements is imposed as shown in Fig. 12b where it can be seen that the interface BC was satisfied precisely. 15                         ) shows excellent agreement with the exact solution and clearly shows that regardless of the average element size, the DBC at y=0.5 was satisfied precisely on each side of the interface. To demonstrate this, consider a simple 55 matrix corresponding to 4 total nodes and 1 interface node. However, our approach is simpler and more efficient in handling larger systems. In this section we investigate the LSF solutions obtained using the MI-FEM where the interface velocity is chosen such that it mimics growth of side branches. We then solved the DRLS equation (77) (case A) where no re-initialization was done, and compared the solution to that obtained using the conventional LS equation (1) (case B) with re-initialization done every 10 time steps, for a total of 5 virtual re-initialization steps. 18                          where we see that the MI-FEM results in a significantly more conservative solution than the conventional FDM. One obvious way to mitigate this issue is to adaptively refine the mesh at the interfacial region. 19                          for a relatively more complex initial geometry with an internal cavity. For a dissolving condition with a normal velocity of 0.1, a stable dissolution of the geometry where breakup and splitting of the interfaces can be easily handled (Fig. To determine the curvature at the interface itself, an additional step is needed where one would generate a point at the interface and then linearly interpolate between the computed curvature at the nearest grid points. The already computed meshfree interpolants and their derivatives at the interface nodes used for solving the DRLS equation can also be used for computing the curvature using Eq. ( In this section we apply the proposed MI-FEM for solving solutal phase transformation in NiB binary system. The final predicted microstructure for a different number of initial solid particles is shown in Fig. The microstructure is dependent on the size of the solid particles and the density of their distribution within the joint. CONCLUSIONS   In this paper we have presented the meshfree interface-finite element method (MI-FEM) as a hybrid meshfree/finite element approach tailored specifically for handling phase transformation problems in 2D and 3D. The theoretical foundation of the MI-FEM has been presented where its main characteristics can be summarized as follows:                                                     1. Representation of solid phases immersed in liquid as dynamic implicit geometries using level set signed distance functions.

27,27,S0168874X14002224," The continuous surface cap (MAT 145) model in LS-DYNA is known by its elegant and robust theoretical basis and can well capture many important mechanical behaviors of concrete. However, it appears to be less popular than many other constitutive models in engineering application due to many material parameters involved in the model formulation which are difficult to calibrate. This study presents an effective calibration method to determine the material parameters for this model as functions of uniaxial compression strength and the maximum aggregate size of concrete according to formulas from CEB-FIP code and concrete test data from other published literatures. The obtained parameters can be conveniently used for occasional users with little or no information on concrete in hand. We further compare the predictions of stressstrain relationship in tension and compression under different confining pressures as well as hydrostatic compression by the model, and validate the model based on impact test of RC beams. Besides, the model is further compared against a similar model-MAT 159 in terms of model performance. The results demonstrate that the model based on the calibrated parameters is capable of offering reasonable and robust predictions. continuous surface (Schwer Murray) cap CSCM concrete concrete damage concrete damage REL3 (K&C concrete) geologic cap Johnson Holmquist concrete Pseudo tensor RHT Winfrith concrete equations of state triaixal compression torsion triaxial extension continuum damage mechanics damage energy release rate used by Simo and Ju [31] reinforced concrete three invariants of stress tensor Rubin scaling function in Eq.

Category one normally adopts an associated flow to calculate the plastic strain increment, and may capture the plastic volume expansion (dilatancy) [6] caused by shear loading at low confining pressure. Typical models belong to this category are the soil and form (MAT 5/14) [3], pseudo tensor (MAT 16) [3], concrete damage (MAT 72) [3,7], Winfrith concrete (MAT 84/85) [3,8], Johnson Holmquist concrete (MAT 111) [3,9], RHT (MAT 272) [3,10] and so on. The third category commonly assumes a non-associated flow in calculating the plastic strain increment. With a sound theoretical basis, the MAT 145 available in LS-DYNA can well capture those behaviors together [3]. To facilitate the calibration of the MAT 145, a brief overview of the model is presented in this section. The MAT 145, proposed originally by Schwer and Murry [2226], is also called the Schwer Murry Cap or continuous surface cap model in LS-DYNA material library. It is assumed that plastic flow, controlled by the shear stresses, may result in permanent deformation without causing degradation of elastic moduli. 1                                                  d                       is a reduction factor associated with the amount of damage at a material point.

In the numerical simulation, the compression or tension are applied to the top surface of the element via Boundary Prescribed Motion keywords with a constant velocity of compression or tension, while the bottom surface is constrained on the motion direction. The predictions by the MAT 145 are apparently higher than those by the MAT 159. Not presented here, a further prediction of the peak tensile strength by the MAT 72 show nearly identical values with those by the MAT 145 for different grade of concrete. long cylinders at three confining pressure of 0, 6.8959MPa (1ksi) and 13.79MPa (2ksi), respectively. It is evident that the predicted results by the MAT 145 compare well with test data in the case of high confining pressure, whilst the predictions by the MAT 159 shows large difference from the test data in all three cases. Fujikake [52,53] conducted tests on RC beams subject to the failing weight impact which will be used in this study to validate the performance of the Mat 145 for concrete under impact loads. C42 concrete with the maximum aggregate size of 10mm was used to generate material parameters for the MAT 145 and MAT 159. The proposed formulae and relationships greatly expedite the engineering application of the model. The proposed method was further verified by a single element and a multi-element simulation by the MAT 145 which offered reasonably good predictions for the stressstrain relationship as compared to experimental results.

28,28,S0168874X14002133," This paper presents a novel approach based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and a simple first-order shear deformation plate theory (S-FSDT) for geometrically nonlinear analysis of homogeneous and non-homogeneous functionally graded plates. Owing to many advantages such as (a) the S-FSDT is free of shear-locking, (b) less one unknown for the S-FSDT as compared with the conventional FSDT, (c) the awkward C 1 continuity required for the generalized displacements is treated straightforwardly because of the nature of the higher-order continuity IGA method, the new formulation is thus effective in modeling the geometrical nonlinearities of plates. The S-FSDT is associated with the von Krmn strain for dealing with small strain and moderate rotation. Numerical validation is analyzed and numerical applications are considered. The obtained results are compared with reference solutions to show the accuracy and the effectiveness of the present approach. The effects of different boundary conditions, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, geometric shape, etc. on the geometrically nonlinear mechanical responses of functionally graded plates are investigated. ","Functionally graded materials (FGM) with high temperature resistance, wear resistance and corrosion resistance have been widely used in various engineering structures. Hence, the development of efficient and accurate nonlinear finite element models becomes crucial. The first-order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT) [5] requires only C                      0 inter element continuity but it suffers from the shear locking effects for thin plates. The isogeometric analysis (IGA) introduced in [12] has devoted to be an efficient and useful numerical method as its main ideas are to adopt the CAD basis functions (e.g., the NURBS) to be the shape functions in the finite element analysis. It is an effective numerical method indeed since it is shown later that accurate modeling in geometrically nonlinear behaviors of plates can be obtained. These features are illustrated in the numerical examples, and in this paper, we consider several numerical examples of homogeneous and non-homogeneous FGPs using the present method. The effects of the boundary condition, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, geometric shape, etc. on the geometrically nonlinear responses of the FGPs are investigated. Let us consider a ceramicmetal FGM plate with thickness                             t                         , and the metal and the ceramic are manufactured to be located on the bottom and the top faces of the plate, respectively. As for the thin plates the shear component                                                                                              w                                                                                                s                                                                                     is small and it can be neglected, by which the theory approaches to the Kirchhoff plate. The numerical results obtained are then compared with the reference solutions. The material properties of the plate are E=2.1106                         N/mm2 and                             v                         =0.316. 3 presents the whole CPU time for different meshes and the normalized load parameter                             P                            =                            25                          derived from the IGA method that integrates either the traditional FSDT or the S-FSDT theory. A circular AlZrO2 FGM plate with radius R=1m and thickness t=0.1m subjected to a uniform transverse load                                                                                              q                                                                                                0                                                                                     is additionally considered to verify the applicability of the present method. The material properties of Al and ZrO2 are already given in Section 4.3. For comparison purpose, this problem is also solved using the ANSYS finite element software package. In this section, the geometrically nonlinear behaviors of the thin and moderately thick FGPs are investigated using the present S-FSDT-based IGA method. When n approaches toward to a very small value but not equal to zero, abrupt change of the axial stress near the bottom surface of the FGP (metal-rich) occurs, whereas sudden change of the axial stress near the top surface of the FGP (ceramic-rich) can be also observed when n is being reached a very large value. 10, it may be concluded that (1) the behaviors of the normalized center deflections for different ratios reveal a similar situation; (2) The center deflections rapidly decrease as the length-to-thickness ratio varies from 5 to 10; while the variations of the center deflections are small as further increasing the length-to-thickness ratio; (3) as expected, the center deflection of the plate asymptotically approaches to a constant value with increasing the length-to-thickness ratio. It can be seen in the table that the center deflection of the plate asymptotically approaches to a constant value with increasing the R/t ratio. Compared with the traditional FSDT, the S-FSDT formulation is free of the shear-locking, as well as less one unknown is saved. 51179063), the National Sci-Tech Support Plan of China (Grant No.",0.700942587832048,0.1908984830805134,0.3000743339250302,0.08172043010752689,0.24675324675324675,0.12277867154485984,0.20344827586206896,0.5363636363636364,0.29499999601250004
29,29,S0168874X15000025," A hierarchical modeling of planar steel frames that is based on a weak coupling of shell and beam computational models is studied in detail. A shell finite element is used to compute failure response of a representative part of each column and each beam of a frame under consideration; elasto-plasticity, geometrical nonlinearity and material softening (along with a localization limiter) are taken into account. The computed results, which naturally include local buckling and/or localized material failure effects, are further incorporated into a beam inelastic stress-resultant constitutive model; the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation EulerBernoulli finite element is considered in this work. The designed beam finite element formulation can be effectively used for the failure analysis of the steel frame. Important issues of such weak coupling concept are presented and results of several numerical simulations are discussed. ","A hierarchical approach to structural modeling is advantageous in many engineering applications. Thus, the weak coupling concept involves carrying out sequential shell and beam computations. However, they can be implicitly included into the beam finite element formulation by using the weak coupling concept suggested in [14] that can be summarized as:                                                     (a)                            Use a geometrically and materially nonlinear (i.e. elasto-plastic) shell finite element formulation (see e.g. [8,31,29,7,16,40,36,11,15]) in order to study response of the representative part of a frame member (RPFM) up to its complete collapse. Also, the effect of the mesh-dependency at steel softening (i.e. at localized steel failure) has to be minimized. In this work, we make use of the embedded-discontinuity-in-rotation EulerBernoulli beam finite element described in [5,14,21], which can model perfectly well, without mesh-dependency, the cross-section softening as well as the frame softening. Use the beam finite element, designed under (b) above, for an effective failure analysis of the entire steel frame; such an analysis is fast and implicitly takes into account localized failures of frame members.",0.5610278372591007,0.4188649080735411,0.4796348183293045,0.13291139240506328,0.16535433070866143,0.14736841611178841,0.30701754385964913,0.3888888888888889,0.343137249971165
30,30,S0168874X14002212," This paper revisits the buckling analysis of a benchmark cylindrical panel undergoing snap-through when subjected to transverse loads. We show that previous studies either overestimated the buckling load and identified a false buckling mode, or failed to identify all secondary solution branches. Here, a numerical procedure composed of the arclength and branch switching methods is used to identify the full postbuckling response of the panel. Additional bifurcation points and corresponding secondary paths are discovered. Parametric studies of the effect of the rise, thickness, and boundary conditions of the panel on the buckling and postbuckling responses are also performed. ","Cylindrical shells are widely used in aerospace, mechanical, and civil engineering applications as structural components in aircraft, tanks, pipelines, and offshore platforms. Early studies on the buckling analysis of cylindrical shells used the classical buckling theory to approximate the bucking loads and mode shapes by assuming membrane prebuckling stress states [14]. These methods are typically valid only in the vicinity of critical points. Some of these disadvantages were solved by replacing the load control with displacement control [20,21], but this approach still fails to track the whole postbuckling path beyond a displacement limit point. Modified versions were later proposed by Crisfield [23] and Tsai et al. [ In Section 2, we briefly introduce the nonlinear buckling analysis algorithm. In this section, we briefly introduce a numerical procedure, combining the arclength and branch-switching methods, which can reliably determine all critical points and corresponding postbuckling responses including bifurcated secondary paths. When an elastic structure is subjected to a conservative loading, the tangent stiffness K is symmetric and Eq.

The material is isotropic with Youngs modulus E=3102.75MPa, and Poissons ratio =0.3. Due to the symmetric geometry, loading and boundary conditions of the panel, many researchers [2535] intuitively assumed that this problem only has symmetric solutions and performed the analysis on one-quarter of the panel to save computational time. Such approach completely eliminates the possibility of identifying possible bifurcation points and secondary paths. In this paper, the full panel is modeled with 27-node solid elements, which are free of locking. 4(b) shows the associated buckling mode that is symmetric to both center planes P                                                     C                          and P                                                     L                          (Fig. 5                         (a) shows the two lowest eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness on the primary equilibrium path: they are initially positive at zero load, and decrease as the applied load increases. The stability of this secondary equilibrium path can be determined by monitoring the eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness on the secondary equilibrium path (Fig. Note that this analysis is still performed on the original mesh, unlike the AMT that would require two more meshes for this task. 9                         (a) shows the three lowest eigenvalues of the tangent stiffness on the secondary equilibrium path 2.

As the rise is increased, the secondary path C starts before the first limit point (Fig. The thickness of the benchmark cylindrical panel is t=6.35mm. The following parameter study examines the influence of thickness, which is varied from 22.86mm to 5.59mm while keeping all other parameters unchanged. 14(a)), and only two pairs of bifurcation points, and secondary paths C and L appear after the first limit point when the constraint is applied to the bottom layer (Fig. Using this approach, two additional pairs of bifurcation points and secondary equilibrium paths are captured for the benchmark example.

31,31,S0168874X14002121," This paper presents finite element implementations for the solution of gradient elasticity problems using the FEniCS project. The FEniCS Project provides a novel tool for the automated solution of partial differential equations by the finite element method. In particular, it offers a significant flexibility with regards to modelling and numerical discretization choices. The weak form of the gradient elasticity problem is derived from the Principal of Virtual Work. An equivalent mixed-type finite element formulation for the strain gradient elasticity problem is implemented in order to avoid the use of C 1 continuous elements. The complete methodology and source codes (python scripts) are provided. Numerical results are presented and compared with well-known benchmark examples, demonstrating the applicability of FEniCS for such applications. ","Cutting edge composite material technology is becoming more dependent on nanosize particles and/or nanostructural systems. To study size effects in micro/nano composite materials, non-local/strain gradient theories currently represent one of the most attractive options as they provide a strong theoretical interpretation that converges to standard behaviours. For example, at the macro-scale, non-local/strain gradient theories seamlessly converge to the standard classical elasticity theory and are also consistent with continuum thermodynamics theory [4447]. Most engineering commercially available software packages for structural/material simulations are based in FEM (e.g. Abaqus [55]). They have previously been considered in several publications, using either the mixed-type finite element formulation [7,53] or meshless methods [17,56]. The main difficulty of using FEM to solve strain gradient elasticity is the continuity requirement (C                      1 continuity). A very important characteristic of the FEniCS environment is its flexibility for changing the governing equations and their method of discretization, allowing the use of highly unusual function spaces. 42] presented a framework for experiments in computational turbulence while Vynnytska et al.

32,32,S0168874X15000049," The elastic contact problem, as implemented in some commercial software such as ANSYS, depends on the user choice of some parameters such as normal contact stiffness, penetration limit and contact algorithms. This work investigates the artificial neural networks (ANN) potential to predict the value of some parameters, avoiding the trial-and-error procedure to determine these values. Contact problems based on simple problems are used to train the neural network, so it can predict the normal contact stiffness for more complex problems. Some contact examples are evaluated, including the small end connecting rod contact problem, of great importance in automobile industry. ","Systems with several parts interacting together are subject to mechanical contact. Some parameters that can be used in the ANN are the penetration level with the normal contact stiffness. There is limited application of ANN in contact problems: in [2], an ANN is used to interpolate the contact parameters associated to a friction factor in multistage forging processes. Thus, the durability of this component is of utmost importance in engines [21]. The results of the estimation of contact parameters using ANN are in Section 5. We present in this section the main aspects of the contact formulation using the Augmented Lagrangian Method and how this method is implemented in the ANSYS software. For more details about these algorithms, refer to [12] for instance. Hence, the penalizing coefficient is not required to reach excessive magnitude, since r has no influence in the optimality condition                                                                                                                          L                                                                                                aum                                                                                       =                            0                         . This is a recognized advantage of the Augmented Lagrangian Method over the classical Penalty Method. This reflects in a new equilibrium equation based on the null gradient condition and in penalty coefficient and Lagrange Multipliers updating in each iteration. Other contact algorithms, as the Lagrangian multiplier method, reorganize the stiffness matrix in order to incorporate the Lagrange multipliers. In ANSYS, the normal contact stiffness is selected by the user in two possibilities: (1) as a stiffness factor k                                                     n                         , which acts as a scale parameter of the contact stiffness K                                                     n                         , or (2) by specifying the magnitude of the contact stiffness K                                                     n                          directly. Usually, the determination of the correct value of this parameter for each contact problem is not evident, and it is more intuitive to use the scale factor k                                                     n                          in order to regulate the level of K                                                     n                         . For high values of the normal contact stiffness, there will be a small penetration. For coarse meshes with larger finite element size, the calculated penetration with FTOLN will be proportionally larger. The neurons receive the information from several sources, then they combine and propagate the information forward in the network. The back-propagation learning rule consists of two steps: a forward step, where the ANN weights are fixed and the input goes through the entire ANN. In this case, the hidden layer neuron error is calculated recursively in function of the local gradient of the external layers. The use of the learning rate and moment term can boost the ANN training convergence [9]. The normal contact stiffness factor is the most important parameter in a contact analysis, since its value influences the penetration level between the contact bodies. It is clear that the choice of the contact stiffness is highly related to the analyst experience in solving different contact problems. The frontal view can be discretized in a 2D mesh, representing the main aspects of the original contact problem. Thus, in order to improve the estimation, the lateral view is used to calculate a correction factor f to put these parameters closer to the expected values of the original 3D problem. Hence, the estimate of k                                                     n                          for the original 3D contact problem is the output of the network. The maximum penetration and maximum contact pressure variation are used as inputs for the back-propagation ANN, providing the normal contact stiffness factor at the ANN output. The inputs of the validation set were not used during the ANN training. There is a uniform distributed surface load on the block of 92.69MPa (total of 10,000N). 7                            (a) and (b) illustrates the ANN training for each input. Table 2                             shows the identification potential of the ANN to predict the normal contact stiffness factor of the 3-dimensional contact problem. It is important to remark that the ANN was trained from data of the 2-dimensional problems. Due to the symmetry, only one-eighth of the problem was modeled. The model is discretized with 86,199 nodes, 7,199 20-node finite elements and 32,226 10-node finite elements. This ANN has 100 neurons in the first layer, 100 neurons in the second layer and one neuron in the third layer. The identified k                                                           n                             from the 3-dimensional problem is given in Table 6                            . For                                                                                                       k                                                                                                         n                                                                                                                               5                            , the difference of the simulation and the expected value of k                                                           n                             is too large. The possible reason for this behavior is that the values of g                                                           max                             and                                                                                                                                      P                                                                                                         max                                                                                              are not well represented in the 2D contact solution. It is expected higher solution times for higher k                                               n                       values. The use of a trained ANN allows to make a reasonable estimation of                                                                                     k                                                                                       n                                                                                                                                                                   to a given maximum penetration, without the inconvenient of the trial-and-error estimation. For the analyzed contact problems, the training time can be considered irrelevant compared to the time to solve a 3-dimensional contact problem, for example. Other types of models could be employed as well in order to assemble a training set for the ANN, for instance, different 3D analysis with similar geometry and loading may give important information about the maximum penetration and maximum contact pressure in the area of interest.

33,33,S0168874X15000062," In [1], a definition is given of the most normal normal. This is the normal that minimizes the maximal angle with a given set of normals. The algorithm proposed does indeed compute a normal that verifies the previous property. However, this may not always be the most normal normal. The previous normal should have more appropriately been called the most visible normal. In the present work, an algorithm is designed to compute the real most normal normal, namely the normal that maximizes the minimum angle with the planes carried by the triangles surrounding a point. This normal is the optimal point normal for boundary layer mesh generation if it is in the visibility cone. The algorithm consists in computing the generalized Voronoi diagram on the sphere of the edges created by the intersection between the triangles and the sphere. Numerical results illustrate the method, and compare with the previous algorithm. ","Surface triangulations are used to describe surfaces in many computer applications. This normal minimizes the maximal angle with the face normals surrounding a given point. 14], this is one of many different definitions of a center of a cone. As noticed in [17], there is a duality between the plane carried by the triangles surrounding a vertex, and the face normals carried by these faces. 2                       depicts the same configurations seen from the dual viewpoint.

34,34,S0168874X15000074," Numerical simulation has increasingly become an effective method and powerful tool for performance-based earthquake engineering research. Amongst the existing research efforts, most numerical analyses were conducted using general-purpose commercial software, which to some extent limits in-depth investigations on specific topics with complicated nature. In consequence, this work develops a new shear wall element model and associated material constitutive models based on the open source finite element (FE) code OpenSees, in order to perform nonlinear seismic analyses of high-rise RC frame-core tube structures. A series of shear walls, a 141.8-m frame-core tube building and a super-tall building (the Shanghai Tower, with a height of 632m) are simulated. The rationality and reliability of the proposed element model and analysis method are validated through comparison with the available experimental data as well as the analytical results of a well validated commercial FE code. The research outcome will assist in providing a useful reference and an effective tool for further numerical analysis of the seismic behavior of tall and super-tall buildings. ","In recent years, research on seismic behavior of tall and super-tall buildings has become increasingly popular, due to rapid construction of this type of buildings and high frequency of earthquakes worldwide. 9] used Perform 3D, a commercial software package widely used for the design and nonlinear analysis of structures, to evaluate the performance of super-tall buildings in earthquakes. Existing commercial software packages offer many notable advantages, particularly in terms of computational stability and convenience of graphic user interfaces (GUI); yet there are several drawbacks. Furthermore, the secondary development functions of commercial software are strictly controlled, making it difficult to integrate the latest research outcomes into their source codes. As an object-oriented open source FE software program for numerical simulation, the Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (OpenSees) (http://opensees.berkely.edu) [15,16] has increasingly become one of the most influential open platforms. The first and foremost challenge is that OpenSees lacks an appropriate and versatile numerical model for shear walls, one of the most important structural components in super-tall buildings [17]. Note that the commercial FE codes of MSC.Marc has been widely used in nonlinear analyses of tall buildings and well validated in terms of rationality and accuracy [16,18]. To facilitate this, a conversion program, from MSC.Marc to OpenSees, is developed to promote the modeling efficiency and ensure consistency of the two analyses using both software packages. Good agreement is also achieved between the analytical results of OpenSees and MSC.Marc. Vector r1 extends from the midpoint of Nodes 2 and 3 to the midpoint of Nodes 1 and 4. Finally, Vector r3 is determined as the cross product of Vectors r1 and r2 following the right hand rule. Cracks are assumed to form when the principal tensile stress exceeds the specified concrete tensile strength. Being simple in formulation, this analytical model also demonstrates a good stability in computation [21,22]. D                                                     e                          is the elastic constitutive matrix, and d                         1 and d                         2 are the damage parameters, which can be respectively calculated by the damage evolution curves under tension as recommended by Lland [23] and under compression as suggested by Mazars [24]. The reinforcing bars are simulated as smeared steel layers of equivalent thicknesses. To achieve this, the slope of the softening branch of cracked concrete is proportionally adjusted according to the element size, leading to identical fracture energy for all elements. In consequence, the crack band theory is recommended and adopted in the following study of both shear walls and super-tall buildings. To compare the performance of the multi-layer shell element and the traditional fiber beam model for shear walls, both are used to simulate the rectangular, H-shaped and T-shaped walls. The differences in their respective modelling strategies are discussed below. When using the fiber beam model, the shear walls are modeled with five non-linear beam-column elements using the compliance method and each element has five integration points [17], as shown in Fig. 33] is adopted to calculate the characteristic parameters of the unconfined and confined concrete. The characteristic parameters of concrete and steel reinforcements are determined from the tensile tests of rebars and the compressive tests of standard concrete cylinders or cubes. It is evident that the majority of the predictions using the multi-shell element agree well with the experimental data, thus validating the reliability and versatility of the multi-layer shell element. Amongst the 18 shear walls given in Table 1, only four typical ones are discussed in detail in this article, the dimensions and reinforcement details obtained from corresponding tests are illustrated in                          Fig. Based on the above, it can be concluded that the multi-layer shell element developed in OpenSees is capable of replicating the complex behavior of various types of shear walls. In particular, the solvers for the sparse symmetric system (i.e., SparesSYM and CuSP) are recommended. One of the case study buildings investigated in this program is Building 2A, a 42-story RC framecore tube structure with a total above ground height of 141.8m [40]. A comparison between the fundamental periods predicted by MSC.Marc and OpenSees is presented in                             Table 3. The slight discrepancy is attributable to different concrete models adopted by these two packages. Considering the contribution of higher-order modes to the seismic response of tall buildings, the 1st and 9th modes are chosen to calculate the coefficients of Rayleigh damping which is recommended by Chopra for most practical analyses [44]. The envelope of inter-story drift curves under the Northridge ground motion is presented in Fig. 13(f) because it has the maximum inter-story drift ratio amongst the three ground motions. The comparisons of the timehistory curves of the roof and the envelope of the inter-story drift curves are illustrated in                                                   Figs. Subsequently, a numerical model system, integrating the fiber-beam elements for beams/columns and the multi-layer shell elements for shear walls/core tubes, is proposed to simulate tall and super-tall buildings using OpenSees. A dynamic analysis of an actual super-tall building is also performed. The research findings of this study will assist in providing an effective tool and a useful reference for further research on the seismic behavior of tall and super-tall buildings based on numerical analysis.

35,35,S0168874X15000050," This work presents a finite strain quadrilateral element with least-squares assumed in-plane shear strains (in covariant/contravariant coordinates) and classical transverse shear assumed strains. It is an alternative to enhanced-assumed-strain (EAS) formulation and, in contrast to this, produces an element satisfying ab initio the Patch-test. No additional degrees-of-freedom are present, unlike EAS. Least-squares fit allows the derivation of invariant finite strain elements which are both in-plane and out-of-plane shear-locking free and amenable to standardization in commercial codes. With that goal, we use automatically generated code produced by AceGen and Mathematica to obtain novel finite element formulations. The corresponding exact linearization of the internal forces was, until recently, a insurmountable task. We use the tangent modulus in the least-squares fit to ensure that stress modes are obtained from a five-parameter strain fitting. This reproduces exactly the in-plane bending modes. The discrete equations are obtained by establishing a four-field variational principle (a direct extension of the HuWashizu variational principle). The main achieved goal is coarse-mesh accuracy for distorted meshes, which is adequate for being used in crack propagation problems. In addition, as an alternative to spherical interpolation, a consistent director normalization is performed. Metric components are fully deduced and exact linearization of the shell element is performed. Full linear and nonlinear assessment of the element is performed, showing similar performance to more costly approaches, often on-par with the best available shell elements. ","Finite strain plasticity and fracture simulations with finite elements (cf. [ We take a different approach here: starting with a mixed 4-field functional (displacement field, director field, components of the local CauchyGreen tensor and the corresponding stress-like Lagrange multipliers), we discretize the resulting EulerLagrange equations making use of suitable shape functions. We therefore describe the technique in the following sections. and                                                                                              S                                                                                                bb                                                                                     the transported stress, whose origin is kinematic. The rationale for using this transformation is the extension of assumed-strain formulations to non-regular quadrilaterals. Tensor                          R                       is introduced to obtain a lamina coordinate system (see, e.g. [28]). 35]), in this case a function of the independent strain increment. The same occurs with (39) as a consequence of using the assumed form of                             S                          and                                                                                              E                                                                                                                                                                                    .

36,36,S0168874X15000037," In this paper, the dynamic large deformation X-FEM method is presented for modeling the full process of dynamic ductile fracture based on a nonlocal damage visco-plasticity model. The effect of inertia is modeled using an explicit central difference scheme which is enhanced through the use of mass lumping, reduced integration with hourglass control, and numerical damping. The material nonlinearity and the flow stress dependency on strain rate, hardening and temperature are modeled with the JohnsonCook visco-plastic model. The micro-void nucleation, growth and coalescence are modeled macroscopically with an isotropic damage model. The localization phenomenon due to the damage and thermal softening is suppressed by using the visco-plastic regularization in combination with the nonlocal visco-plastic model. The large deformation and large strain formulations are implemented within the X-FEM framework to model the macro crack discontinuities using an updated Lagrangian approach. Crack propagation and crack direction criteria are presented and the issues relating to the combination of X-FEM with the damage visco-plasticity model are addressed. Finally, the robustness and accuracy of the proposed method are verified through several numerical examples. ","Dynamic fracture is a branch of fracture mechanics that considers the fracture phenomena for which the material inertia becomes important. In the overstress models the plasticity multiplier is explicitly expressed as a function of state variables and the stress does not remain on the yield surface. This issue simplifies the introduction of such models into the existing codes. The JohnsonCook [3], the ZerilliArmstrong [4] and the SteinbergCochranGuinanLund [5] models are in this category. Atkins and Mai [8] illustrated that the fracture strain depends on the hydrostatic pressure. However, the method is mesh sensitive and does not conserve the mass of the system [18]. 26]; in contrast to the standard-FEM the mesh does not need to be confined to the crack body and hence the remeshing strategy is removed in the crack propagation. 39] and Broumand and Khoei [40,41] employed the X-FEM method to model the ductile fracture in equilibrium, low cycle fatigue and rate independent dynamic loadings. The JohnsonCook visco-plastic model is used to model the flow stress dependency on strain rate, isotropic hardening and temperature. The plan of the paper is as follows; in Section 2, the governing equation of a fractured body is derived based on an updated Lagrangian large deformation formulation, and the equation of motion is discretized using the X-FEM method. Since the crack-tip enrichment is not considered in the above formulation, it is needed to utilize a special enrichment strategy to model the stress concentration at the crack-tip region. The only exception is the element that contains the crack-tip; in this element only the nodes of an edge (ad) which is cut by the crack body and not by the crack-tip, are enriched. The time integration of the equation of motion is performed using the central difference method, which is an explicit direct time integration method with the second-order accuracy. 56] to simulate the damage evolution in the perforation of a ductile plate by a steel bullet. The assumption of adiabatic condition simplifies the procedure of solution; in such case the temperature is not considered as a nodal degree of freedom, and the energy equation is decoupled from the equation of motion and it is solved at each integration point separately. In order to improve the performance of the formulation in localization phenomena, a nonlocal plasticity model is utilized which is similar to the method originally proposed by Mediavilla et al. [ The main drawback of the above formulation is its computational cost. The idea behind the method is that the crack grows whenever the whole length covering the new crack segment                                                                                                                                                                                              c                                                                                     is damaged. Another key issue observed here is that if the material characteristic length is large compared to the FE mesh size; several DCP points may reach the critical value simultaneously. However in large deformation X-FEM damage-viscoplasticity analysis, the geometry and material behavior are dependent on the history of loading and the analysis must be carried out incrementally. For each new enriched element, all neighboring elements including the enriched element are selected in a set called . Hence, the equation of motion and constitutive equations cannot be satisfied and the inconsistency can be caused in the solution. For all examples, the bilinear 2D elements are employed, and the enriched elements are subdivided into 55 sub-rectangles with four Gauss points at each sub-rectangle. The tensile specimen is a circular bar with radius of 1cm and height of 10cm, as shown in                          Fig. 6, the von-Mises stress contours are presented for both cases in the absence of thermal effects. Although it was expected to observe the necking behavior at the bottom edge of one-quarter specimen for both loading conditions due to a geometric imperfection at this area, the interaction of input waves in the second case before reaching the bottom edge of the specimen, results in the plastic yielding of the top region and changes the pattern of necking in the specimen. The predicted results are again in good agreement with those obtained from the ABAQUS program that illustrates the accuracy of proposed JohnsonCook model within the computational algorithm. 5, it can be seen that the plastic heat generation results in more softening behavior particularly at the necking stage. 8, the temperature contours are presented for both loading conditions. For simplicity of the solution, it is assumed that the value of damage remains constant when the damage reaches its critical value D                                                     c                         , and no cracks are added into the system. 9, the forcedisplacement diagrams are plotted for various meshes. In this case, a ramped prescribed displacement of 1cm is applied at the left edge of the specimen in 0.001s, as shown in Fig. 4; a mesh of 520 elements is used for numerical modeling, and the critical time step is set to t=108                         s. The problem is solved for n=1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10,000, and the corresponding forcedisplacement diagrams are plotted in                          Fig. It clearly illustrates that a good combination of t and n must be employed to obtain an accurate result. The next example is chosen to illustrate the capability of proposed computational algorithm in a complex geometry with mixed mode crack propagation under dynamic loading. The plate is in plane strain condition with an initial temperature of 293K that is made from a steel alloy with the material properties given in Table 1. However, the visco-plastic strain has maximum values at the top and bottom notches, as can be seen from Fig. In order to obtain a similar crack pattern, the fracture strain is set to a constant value of                                                                                                                                                                                              F                                                                                       =                            0.4                          in the following parts of the simulation. In the second part of the numerical simulation, the prescribed displacement is applied as a ramp function within two time intervals of =0.001s and 0.0001s. It can be seen that due to effects of the damage, thermal softening and crack propagation, the stress level reduces at various time steps in the localization area as well as the whole plate. The geometry and boundary conditions of the problem are shown in                          Fig. 20, the damage contours are shown at different stages of crack propagation for the time interval of =0.01s. Obviously, the forcedisplacement diagram of case I illustrates three distinct stages; firstly a linear and nonlinear behavior before the crack propagation, secondly a drop in the diagram due to rapid crack growth in the ligaments, and lastly the crack propagation process in the central part of the specimen. In case II, the dynamic behavior is clearly dominant however, the overall performance follows the forcedisplacement diagram represented in case I. In Fig. In the second part of the numerical simulation, the overall performance of the specimen is investigated to the nonlocal characteristic length. For this purpose, the loading cases I and II are employed to simulate the specimen for the characteristic lengths of                                                         =                            0.1                         ,                             0.2                          and 0.3mm. 23(a) and (b), the forcedisplacement diagrams are respectively plotted for the loading cases I and II. An explicit central difference algorithm was employed in combination with the mass lumping, reduced integration with hourglass control, and numerical damping.

37,37,S0168874X15000104," This paper presents a topology optimization method for the frequency response of a multiphysics system involving fluidstructure interaction. The finite element analysis of the system is carried out based on the u s / p f formulation. The structural domain is governed by the linear equation of elasticity and expressed in terms of the displacement, u s , and the fluid domain is described by Helmholtz equation via the primary variable of pressure, p f . The coupling conditions are the equilibrium and kinematic compatibilities at the fluidstructure interface. The optimization procedure used in this work is based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO). Due to the binary characteristics of the BESO method of adding/removing material, the methodology proposed here circumvents some problems faced by the traditional density based optimization methods, especially concerning the fluidstructure interface during the optimization process. The proposed methodology can be applied to various engineering problems such as noise reduction in passenger compartments in automobiles and aircraft, and vibration control of submerged structures. Several numerical examples are presented demonstrating that the proposed BESO method can be used for the topology optimization of these kinds of multiphysics problems effectively and efficiently for 2D and 3D cases. ","In the past few decades topology optimization has been used to improve the characteristics and increase the performance of a wide variety of systems. In this context, the aim of this work is to develop a topology optimization procedure to minimize frequency responses of coupled fluidstructure systems using the evolutionary topology optimization methodology. The solid domain is governed by the elasticity equation and the fluid domain by Helmholtz equation. The two separate fields are fully coupled by the surface-coupling integral in each step of the optimization process, which guarantees equilibrium conditions on the acoustic-structural interface. 3) represents the structural displacement constraint applied to the structure; Eq. ( 5) indicates the action of pressure forces exerted by the fluid on the structure and represents the equilibrium condition at the interface between the domains. In this section the optimization problem is stated, the sensitivity analysis is derived and the evolutionary procedure is described. Huang and Xie [48] presented an efficient interpolation scheme for frequency optimization problems in order to avoid artificial localized modes in areas with low-densities. The procedure used here to smooth the sensitivity number is described in detail by Huang and Xie [33]. For some cases, the optimization process is carried out with a constant structural volume, in this case V                                                     i                         =V                                                     f                         . Depending on the design problem, if a void cavity is not allowed to exist, all structural elements are replaced by fluid ones. After the topology update in the system, the interface coupling matrix,                                                                                              L                                                                                                sf                                                                                    , is calculated again considering all alterations in the properties of the elements. Define the optimization parameters: V                                                                       i                                  , V                                                                       f                                  , ER, AR                                                                       max                                   and p.  Carry out the finite element analysis for the coupled problem. Adding and removing elements according to the procedure described previously. In this section, some examples of optimization considering the presented fluidstructure model are solved using the extended BESO method. The first example is about the displacement minimization of one vibrating structure inside a fluid cavity. In all cases, the initial guess design starts at 60% of the structural domain and the optimization process is conducted at a constant structural volume fraction. 4                             shows the pressure distribution for the initial design and the pressure distribution for the optimized topology found with the BESO method. In the second case the BESO method is applied to optimize the system considering the excitation frequency of the external load of =120Hz. The optimization process continues until the objective function satisfies the convergence criterion. The evolution histories of the objective function and the structural topologies can be seen in Fig. The interface between the fluid and the structure is well defined during the optimization progress for all cases analysed. The problem can be physically interpreted as a loudspeaker located in the inner cavity and the objective is to design the structural domain for minimizing the noise at the top line at the outer cavity. The finite element mesh used has 129,240 four-node quadrilateral elements. The evolution history of the objective function is shown in Fig. 14                          for the initial and optimized designs. As a consequence of the optimization process, the gap between the first and second natural frequencies has increased in the optimized system. By moving the position of the natural frequencies of the coupled system, the proposed methodology is able to reduce the objective function in 93% in the frequency range analysed in this case. In all external walls of the fluid domain are applied the rigid wall boundary condition,                             n                                                                                    p                            =                            0                         . 17 for the initial guess design and for the final topology after the convergence. The fundamental frequency of the coupled system is included in the frequency range of optimization for the initial guess design. After 48 iterations, the convergence criterion is reached and the process ends with a reduction of the objective function by 82% of its initial value. In this example, the proposed methodology is extended to a three dimensional case. The structural domain consists of the non-design part and the design domain which is designed in order to minimize the objective function. In the fluid medium, the rigid wall boundary condition is applied to all external boundaries. The material properties of the structural domain (steel) are the Youngs modulus of 200GPa, density of 7700kg/m3 and Poissons ratio of 0.3. And the fluid domain (mercury) has density of 13,600kg/m3 and the speed of sound in the media is 1450m/s. The update scheme of removing and adding elements is set to allow the presence of three phases in the design domain. For better visualization of the structural topology, the structural domain is plotted in Fig. After the optimization process reaches the final prescribed volume, 40%, at the 40th iteration, the process continues until the 59th iteration at a constant volume when the convergence criterion is achieved.

38,38,S0168874X15000086," In this paper the correlation of deformation energy and critical buckling loads is examined. An advanced analysis technique is derived for the investigation of z-section frames typically applied in composite aircraft fuselage. This technique is verified through closed form solutions of z-section columns under quasi-static loading conditions. The method is applied to study the effects of flange width and laminate thickness on the critical failure modes of composite frames. Therein, the focus is on composite structural elements favourable for deformation kinematics in aerospace applications subjected to crash loads. ","Research and technology projects on aircraft fuselage pursue the application of lightweight materials to achieve improved structural efficiency. Structural designs applying such composite materials need to satisfy the authorities airworthiness code for an equivalent level of safety [1] compared to current metallic fuselage designs. 3] highlighted the significance of the frames structural response, such as buckling deformation and limit load, in a crash landing scenario. The investigations outlined in this paper therefore concern straight frames instead of curved frames. This paper consequently provides an analysis technique for the investigation of critical loads and their corresponding deformation energy in CFRP z-section frames. Considering open sections such as the present CFRP z-section, closed form solutions are provided by Shan [6], Qiao and Shan [7], and Kollr and Springer [8] for the local buckling behaviour under uniaxial static compressive load. These formulae are derived for orthotropic and symmetrical laminates. Following Kollr and Springers approach, the critical buckling load of a CFRP z-section column is calculated as outlined in Eqs. ( This stacking sequence was kept constant for all the calculations within this verification section. The dimension b                                                     f                          covers the entire section width. The verification example was purposely selected to suit these conditions. In fact, the same ANSYS ADPL script is used for pre- and post-processing. Similar to the nonlinear buckling calculation, an initial geometric imperfection was applied by updating the geometry with the mode shape pattern used previously. To control possible hourglass effects, the stiffness form of Type 2 was used to define the hourglass viscosity. 13] point out that even the onset of failure is mesh-sensitive. However, the material model used allows adjustment of the compressive failure load by parameter adoption. Although highly recommended by Rohwer [20], an experimental validation is not the goal of this paper. This section provides an approach for the review of quasi-static buckling analyses executed with the nonlinear explicit solver LS-Dyna. The axial load corresponding to that buckling mode was well below the compressive strength of the material outlined in Table 1. 5                          shows the buckling mode shape using explicit analysis. However, from the contour plot the axial displacement of the free end as well as the overlaying buckling pattern becomes obvious. This subsection summarises the verification method outlined above. Due to the application of initial geometric imperfection, the analyses feature the same mode shape which was obtained from the eigenvalue analysis in the first step. With respect to the numerical analyses, the buckling loads of the analytic solution are conservatively estimated. The offset to the numerical solutions results from the following assumptions. In order to reduce the calculation time for each run, the load may be applied at a loading rate above the quasi-static regime, for example 100mm/s. Within these calculations, dynamic effects such as inertia are to be considered. The suggestion is therefore discarded for the method proposed in this paper. Furthermore, the aspect ratio of the finite elements was specified approximately one for mesh construction. Secondly, when the numerical modelling approach has been verified for straight frames, it will be applied to studies on curved frames. For this section Table 5                       provides an overview of the key parameters. It relates the column length l to the moment of gyration r.                                                     (8)                                                                                          =                               l                               /                               r                                                                           Since there are two distinct principal axes of inertia  and ,  is found with respect to these. However, the necessary formulae can be found in Wiedemann [14]. 6                       indicates the methodology applied to obtain the critical buckling load and its corresponding internal energy. Since explicit analyses have been run, the corresponding internal energy value was obtained at the unique time increment of critical buckling occurrence. Since the data consists of distinct data points, the function connecting these points becomes piece-wise linear. However, modes III and IV were superposed by a local component as shown in Fig. The peak at                                                   =                         45                       actually results from a change in mode shape. The peaks along the energy curve coincide with the mode shape change occurrences. This is an important point to consider when energy absorption capabilities and deformation kinematics are of interest. In the previous section, a framework for automated analysis and data processing was configured. However, this section features the variation of the cross-sectional dimensions b                                               f                       and t. Since the thickness t is the result of a composite stacking sequence, it is varied in three discrete steps as outlined in Table 6                      . Effect of flange width: The effect of the flange width on the critical buckling load as well as the internal energy is studied. BF42 denotes an overall flange width of 42mm, 21mm on either side of the web. This configuration was discussed in detail in the previous section (see Fig. The range of lateral-torsional buckling mode (III) increases to both sides of the -range. The critical buckling forces are above the two previous configurations. In that range, the overall mode shape development of the BF28 configuration is governed by the web instead of the flanges. The stiffening effect of the flanges appears to be nonlinear, converging against an upper boundary. Although the flange width increases by 1/3 from BF42 towards BF56, the critical buckling loads increase by approximately 4% for the values at onset of lateral-torsional buckling. Instead, the laminate thickness was varied in three discrete steps as outlined in Table 6. For the slenderness ratio                          20                         <                                                  <                         90                      , the critical mode is not easy to distinguish. The deformation energy increases with increasing composite thickness. Similar to the stiffening effect of the increased flange width, a range of deformation energy appears, at almost constant critical buckling load for increased composite thickness. This makes it a major task regarding energy absorption characteristics of structural elements in deformation kinematics of the aircraft fuselage sub-floor area. From a design point of view, increasing the laminate thickness is more effective in terms of increasing deformation energy and buckling loads, compare Figs. The results presented here allow the designer to not only estimate critical buckling loads but also to simultaneously consider deformation energy aspects following the recommended steps below:                        Step 1: Establish a reliable parametric numerical model. Step 2: Configure a framework for automated structural analyses and data processing. This provides the basis for generating results and understanding the investigated effects, rather than trailing of in repetitive work tasks. Similarly, the relation between deformation energy and critical buckling force may be quantified. In this study, the use of explicit FE analyses led to approximately 15% lower buckling load compared to analytical solutions. When structural elements are subjected to a certain amount of energy as, for example, strain energy acting axial-compressively, they may be loaded beyond their critical load limit. Using the methodology presented here, an analysis of curved z-section frames becomes viable.",0.956661316211878,0.0731557628574935,0.135918888740171,0.026831785345717233,0.3023255813953488,0.049289098028633724,0.09619238476953908,0.7619047619047619,0.17081850334741203
39,39,S0168874X15000116," An efficient approach is presented for optimal domain decomposition of finite element meshes in conjunction with k-median method and a meta-heuristic algorithm. A clique graph is used for transforming the connectivity of a finite element model (FEM) into that of the corresponding graph. Subsequently, to decompose the nodes of a graph or the meshes of a finite element model to k subdomains, k-median approach is employed. Then, for finding k medians of graph, a recently developed meta-heuristic algorithm, so-called Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO), and standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are utilized. The performance of these methods is investigated through four FEMs to minimize the cost of k-median problem. A comparison of the numerical results using the CBO and PSO algorithms indicates that the CBO is capable of performing better decomposition using smaller or equal computational efforts. ","Parallel processing has been widely applied to large-scale problem like the analysis of hydraulic systems, electrical networks and finite element meshes. The aim of a parallel algorithm is to decompose the given domain of system into subdomains, and analyze each subdomain by a processor. As a newly developed meta-heuristic algorithm, the Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO) is introduced for design of structural problems [18,19]. Each CB is considered as an object with a specified mass and velocity before the collision. A simple graph G is defined as a set N(G) of nodes and a set E(G) of edges together with a relation of incidence which associate two distinct nodes with each edge, known as its ends. A spanning tree is a tree containing all the nodes of G. A shortest route tree (SRT                                                     n0) rooted from a specified node (starting node) n                                                     0                         , is a spanning tree for which the distance between every node n                                                     j                          of T and n                         0 is minimum. In order to illustrate the domain decomposition method, the finite element mesh shown in                          Fig. The burden of each processor is solving n/4 equations and finding the internal nodal displacements of submeshes. An automatic finite element domain decomposer should meet four basic requirements in order to be efficient:                                                           a)                               It should be able to handle irregular geometry and arbitrary discretization in order to be general purpose. It must yield a set of balanced subdomains in order to ensure that the overall computational load be as evenly distributed as possible among the processor. 10), then we say the node j is allocated to i. A shortest route tree can be rooted from each node to obtain the shortest distance between this node and the remaining nodes [5]. Therefore, in this work the proposed optimization algorithm considered with continuous variables and the number of variables in optimization algorithm is 2k. The sorted CBs are equally divided into two groups:                                                                                                            The lower half of CBs (stationary CBs); These CBs are good agents which are stationary and the velocity of these bodies before collision is zero. The change of the body position represents the velocity of these bodies before collision as:  After the collision, the velocity of bodies in each group is evaluated using the collision laws and the velocities before collision. New positions of CBs are obtained using the generated velocities after the collision in position of stationary CBs. Apart from the efficiency of the CBO algorithm, which is illustrated in the subsequent section through numerical examples, the proposed algorithm does not include internal parameters besides the coefficient of restitution (COR). In these examples, the number of agents is set to 20 individuals. Capability and robustness of two algorithms are investigated for four different finite elements. 5, the number of meshes is set as 2601 (                            51                                                        51                         ). The numbers of medians considered in this example are set as k={5 and 6}. 15 and 16 show the optimal subdomains obtained using the CBO algorithm for different values of k and the convergence curves of the best result obtained for this example, respectively. Then, the medians of graph are selected based on optimization algorithm with continues variables.",0.7174151150054765,0.1748065118761676,0.2811168483209249,0.04042553191489362,0.14960629921259844,0.06365158794025982,0.1553030303030303,0.47126436781609193,0.2336182298896925
